# The Sacred Cow Principle

> There are no sacred cows at Treefrog.

<i>The single most important rule at Treefrog is that there are no single most important rules at Treefrog. This would limit our growth.</i>

Ironically, if the one rule is there are no iron-clad rules: does this mean that maybe some rules are actually iron-clad?

If you ever hear a Frog say "This is way we've always done this" - you know suddenly there is an opportunity to challenge why we are doing it that way and completely rethink why we are doing it that way. Perhaps our ideas are based in baggage or history that is no longer relevant to this stage in our growth?
