> The Rule of Thumb

*At its core, Treefrog believes that work and life should not be antagonistic towards one another. This is not a matter of priority, but rather of balance. This is in contrast to the classic "work-life balance" metaphor from the 60's, where work and life are intentionally segregated into their respective time slots.*
