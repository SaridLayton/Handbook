# No Better Company

> This is the best place for you to work. If it isn't, try to change it. If you can't, no harm done. Go work at the place you believe is better - we'll recommend you (providing you deserve the recommendation).

*No person should be slave to their employer. If for some reason, the conditions for success do not exist for you as an employee to be happy and successful (or better stated: the conditions exist somewhere else for you to be more so), than you should leave without fanfare to explore this new place.*

Having said that - if you can find the perfect place to work, **don't go get a job there**, because you will probably ruin it by going to work there.

A workplace is a summation of the individuals who work there and the personal energy they give to the team, not a magical place from which happiness and fulfillment flow. Many people believe they are entitled to a fantastic place to work. Unfortunately, this just isn't true. Life is nasty, brutish and short - and everyone has limited opportunities to live a happy life, and even fewer to live an exemplary life.
