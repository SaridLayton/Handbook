# Ownership

> Anything produced by Treefrog is owned by Treefrog.

All work products produced by all salaried Frogs during his or her salaried tenure at Treefrog is owned by Treefrog. This includes all works *that would be created by Treefrog during the course of regular work*, including but not limited to, graphic design, code, written content,and pretty much anything you do or think. We share a brain, and we own together what comes from our brains.

You cannot have have flexible hours, forgiving attitudes, work the odd evening to catch up and then suddenly "be working on something else not relevant to the company".

We are a service company. We could get sued by our clients, and have, if it turns out you were working on something else or by mistake conflated ideas they paid for into what you are doing.

### Side Projects

You can, with explicit permission and within specific boundaries that Treefrog deems to be acceptable, work on specific projects that you own. Each project must be clearly articulated and disclosed and recieve specific permission in each case.

By definition, these projects would need to be completely outside the boundaries of Conflict of Interest.

### Sharing Work on Portfolios

#### Rationale
- We have been sued before when someone posted client work on their own personal site.
- Work that you do at Treefrog should be work that has alternate Frogs working with you to make it excellent. Therefore, it is rare that work that you have done is exclusively yours.
-  All projects should be executed on Treefrog’s equipment and would then be considered to be solely owned by Treefrog. If the project is contractually articulated, the client for whom it has been developed for would be the sole owner. 
-  This work may not be shared or used externally from Treefrog. This includes any work completed for a Frog’s personal use, such as a portfolio.

If a Frog’s employment is terminated, including resignation, all work created while employed by Treefrog must be returned to Treefrog and, all remnants must be deleted from the individual’s personal device. No information may be forwarded or shared with any third party operation.

Using work created at Treefrog outside of the Treefrog environment, will lead to legal action.
