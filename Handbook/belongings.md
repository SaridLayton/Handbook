> Keep your stuff at home and Treefrog's stuff at Treefrog.

Frogs are discouraged from bringing personal items to the workplace. If necessary, only the minimal amount of personal belongings should be kept at the workplace and it is the Frogâ€™s responsibility to keep them in a secure location. Treefrog will not accept responsibility for lost, stolen, or damaged articles. This includes the use of your own personal devices at work.

#### Why?

Bottom line, they aren't insured. In addition, they could be stolen, or "borrowed", or damaged by others, and are considered to be outside of our bubble of liability. Best to not mix personal items with Treefrog items if at all possible.
