# Out of Office

#### Phone

### Email

When you are going to be away from the office, the following things need to be included in your out of office message:

1. Greeting
2. How long you are away for and if you may have access to your email
3. Who to contact in your absence. This must be a person
4. If the sender is a client to contact support (this applies to everyone in the entire company)
5. Treefrog Signature

Here's an example:

Greetings,

Thank you for your email. Please note, I am away from the office with no access to email from Monday June 22nd until Thursday July 2nd, 2015.

If your matter is urgent, please call the office during regular business hours and speak with Andrea Gust, extension 113, or email, andrea@treefrog.ca.

If you are an existing client requiring website or network support, please email support@treefrog.ca

Otherwise, I very much look forward to speaking with you upon my return!
