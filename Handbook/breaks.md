# Breaks

> Treefrog does not pay for breaks.

If you are working on Treefrog stuff, Treefrog should pay you. If you are doing something else, Treefrog shouldn't pay you. This is true, irrelevant to your location (i.e. at Treefrog, at home, or in Oagadogo), your previous experience at other workplaces, or because of anything else you have heard.

#### Meal Breaks

Meal breaks are not paid for by Treefrog. The standard meal break allotted time is 30 minutes and it is best for your health if you take this time. Requests for exceptions to the 30 minutes must be made in writing and approved prior to the event. The standard meal break must not interrupt workflow or meetings. Therefore, be sensitive in scheduling meal breaks accordingly.

External meetings, such as client or networking meetings, where a meal is provided as part of the meeting, are considered to be the standard meal break.

If you qualify as an [information-technology-professional](manual/information-technology-professional.md) or [manager](manual/manager.md), you may choose to work through this lunch while at your desk and continue your work. By doing so (and thus not taking an official break), you may reduce the [hours](manual/hours) you are at Treefrog. It is our recommendation that you take a break regardless of how short it is and stretch your legs. The option exists for your convenience and overall efficiency.

Meeting during lunch also counts as "working time", providing the material covered during the meeting is exclusively work related. This is a great way to work on a collaborative team project, if you have one, without losing efficiency.

Having said all this, breaks are good for you. Take breaks!

#### Coffee Breaks

Treefrog does not standardize coffee breaks to two 15 minute breaks like most manufactories. Employees may take breaks for tea/coffee/smoking at their discretion based on their individual work schedules.

You are not paid for the time during which you are taking a break.

#### Washroom Breaks

Go pee. If it takes less than 5 minutes and your brain doesn't turn off, leave your clock running. If you stop to chat, make a phone call, study some art, or read a magazine, you are on your own time.

You don't need to put up your hand. If the break is not incredibly quick, you are paying for it, not the client or the rest of the Frogs.
