# Absenteeism and Tardiness

<fieldset><legend>The Rule:</legend>
If you are not working when you are reasonably expected to be working, you are absent or late.

<fieldset><legend>The Spirit:</legend>
In order to be successful as an organization, wherever possible people need to be contributing consistently at an expected level, or our team suffers.

Treefrog has [flexible hours](hours#flexible_hours) for most positions (with the exception of positions which are critical to client-facing localized hours - e.g. tech support, front desk, etc., for reasons of [customer-service](manual/customer-service.md). However, if you have set an expectation to be at Treefrog at a certain time, other Frogs will be counting on you being there. By not being available when you have promised to be, you increase the [cost-of-chaos](manual/cost-of-chaos.md) and reduce the overall effectiveness of the team.

Frogs are responsible for contacting their [Pod Champion](manual/pod-champion.md) before the start of his or her [regular committed hours] if he or she is going to be absent or late. Frogs can be absent or late because of any of the following:

1. [Sickness](manual/sickness.md)
2. An [emergency](manual/emergency.md) (an accident)
3. Inclement [weather](manual/weather.md)
4. Traffic issues
5. Child or pet-related illness or emergency
6. etc.

(Many of these specifics are covered in their own section of the Manual.)

When a Frog’s absences are due to both the number and frequency of personal absences becomes excessive as compared to the company’s average or the absences established a pattern - Mondays, Fridays - the Frog’s absenteeism will be considered **excessive**.

Frog’s with excessive absences will receive a letter issued by their [pod-champion](manual/pod-champion.md) that will detail attendance records and set performance expectations over a defined period of time.

If absences continue, a further meeting will be held to identify the reasons for the ongoing absences. Each case will be reviewed individually and appropriate steps will be taken in accordance to the severity of the issue.

Majority of the work done at Treefrog is interdependent on co-workers. Therefore, it is extremely important that Frogs are punctual and consistent with his or her schedule. Habitually arriving late for work is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action.

### Warn Your Pod Champion

You must notify your [pod-champion](manual/pod-champion.md) about time required off for personal appointments at least 48 hours prior to the time missed. Appointments should be made at the beginning or end of day whenever possible. Excused time off for appointments must be made up and these hours must be approved by your [pod-champion](manual/pod-champion.md).

Absence due to tardiness must be made up based on a schedule approved by your Pod Leader.

#### Slack Warnings

If you are going to be late, need to take moments off, or feel sick, etc, please make a point of letting the team know in the below channel on Slack;

https://treefrog.slack.com/messages/absent/

1. 24 Hours Notice - Our Handbook states that you need to give at least 24 hours notice for time off. We are pretty lenient with this idea (Frog for Life!), but it is helpful to the team to have advance warning. Not as a measure of bureaucracy but of mutual respect and love.

2. 24 Hours Notice - Telling people 3 months ahead of time you won't be available doesn't help. Warn people in reaonable measure with the anticipated activity.

3. Don't follow the channel unless you need to - You shouldn't need to follow the channel (Cost of Chaos!), but rather go in and look if you are wondering where people are. Exclusions are communication hubs, i.e. Robyn.

4. You must Notify - There needs to be a record of why you are absent. Otherwise, you cost other people time and energy. Slack is fine for this.

5. And make sure you call out people you will be affecting, especially your pod. You might even additionally post to your pod channel if it is a heavy/confusing week.

6. Tell people why - Please also indicate why. If it is a private issue, please just note something general so people aren't left wondering, confused, and/or conflicted. Imagine the impact on your pod if you could be headed into something. An issue such as "I am having an emergency bypass", though your right to keep to yourself, has obvious greater impact than "There is a emergency sale on shoes at The Bay and I will be catching up later this evening on my hours".

#### Example of Appropriate Messages:

- "Reminder: I will be out for a doctor's appointment tomorrow after 3:00pm. Just a checkup. Call or Slack with emergencies 905-392-6997 ATTN: @Kevin"
- "I have a migraine, so I need to go home. I should be in tomorrow, they usually only last a day. Slack only, I'll check when subsides. ATTN: @Jim"

####Some reminders for all involved;

- If you are sick, get better. If you need to go to a doctor or dentist, don't wait. We work around one another.
- Working from home is a privilege, not a right. Not being here makes you more difficult to communicate with, less likely to help Treefrog and yourself be successful. Only work from home if it is absolutely necessary, not because it would be nice.
- Getting an appointment late or early in the day is usually achieved through simply asking for it - saving you a complete-day-meltdown. Ask for it, and come to work for as long as possible.

We don't want Treefrog to be antagonistic towards life. However, we don't want life to be antagonistic towards Treefrog. These things can and should be in harmonious balance and can be achieved through communication to the right people at the right time.
