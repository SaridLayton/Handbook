#### Timesheet System

> As much as possible, track your time as you go. Reconciliation time is leakage.

Accurate time keeping must be maintained on a daily basis, must be completed, and must reconciled at the end of each week, Friday, in order to receive a paycheque. These timesheets are critical for client billing, job costing, and payroll. You must use the time sheeting system prescribed by Treefrog.

All paid time must be tracked, including but not limited to, production time, management time, sales meetings, internal meetings, technical failures, phone calls, etc. Tasks that take less than (5) minutes should be tracked. Tasks that take longer than 25 minutes may be rounded up to the nearest 10 minute increment.

You are required to complete and log 40 hours per week. Anything less than 40 hours is an indicator that you have not worked a full week and you will be required to make up those hours in the following week. Failure to make up these hours within the proceeding week will result in disciplinary action unless previous arrangements have been made with management.

It is fraudulent, making it illegal, to inflate or doctor any time expenditure in the timesheet system or “guess” times at a later date, Consequently, you must maintain your timesheet daily. Failure to keep an ongoing timesheet is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action or termination.

Retroactively adding time to the time-sheet system from over 2 weeks ago is unreasonable as it will affect project evaluations and likely be biased or incorrect. Do not retroactively add time from over 2 weeks ago without your [Pod Champion](Pod Champion) requesting that you do so. 

### Time Tracking

Frogs are responsible to track all of their working hours and time in the “Frog web” timesheet system. Accurate time keeping must be maintained on a daily basis and must be reconciled at the end of the week. Time sheets are critical for client billing, proposals and payroll. The time sheet system is mandatory for all frogs. All paid time must be tracked, including production time, management time, sales meetings, internal meetings, technical failures, phone calls etc. All tasks from 1 minute should be tracked and tasks greater than 25 minutes should be rounded up to the nearest 10 minute increment.

You are required to complete and log 40 hours per week. Anything less than 40 hours will be rolled into the next week and you are required to make up that time.

It is against company policy and considered time theft to make any inaccurate recordings on your timesheet therefore you must maintain your timesheet on a daily basis. Failure to keep an ongoing timesheet is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

*If FrogWeb shows you below 40 hours of work in a trailing quarter, there are red flags and you are not consider you for the ~hour of admin time to dig into your time expenditure and overall contribution to the team to consider you for a raise. Other people get the conversation first - we consider your fewer hours of negative value as equivalent to an unrealized cash bonus you have self-assigned.*

*Depending on your role, if FrogWeb shows more than ~2-3 hours a week of "Admin" time over and above your 40 hours (and your role doesn't necessitate this by definition), I see red flags. You are possibly putting time in for stuff you shouldn't (like "computer failure", or "lunch", or "an error on a specific site I should have fixed", "cleaning up after a client when I should have billed it under a project"). It makes me ask questions of you in my head about how you are using it and what you are hiding. You can and should track this stuff under Admin, but it should balance out to some degree with work and/or 40+ hours. (You should be raising the flag that your computer isn't working properly and/or trying to do something else effective, not sitting around burning admin time twiddling your thumbs.)*
