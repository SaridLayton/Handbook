# Hours

The standard work week consists of 40 paid hours, Monday to Friday; 9:00 am to 5:30 pm each day. Any exceptions to the standard work day hours must be represented and approved by his or her Pod Leader prior to the event.

### Flexible Hours

Treefrog offers an alternative of flexible working hours for roles at Treefrog who qualify as [information-technology-professionals](manual/information-technology-professionals.md) or [managers](manual/managers.md). For those individuals who wish to have flexible hours, a request for these hours must be approved by the Pod Leader who will reasonably and appropriately allow for these flexible hours.

> Flexible Hours does not mean, "I work whenever I want". Flexiable Hours means, "I have the flexibility to be accomodated for my lifestyle by setting specific hours for when I work, and my Flexible Hours do not hurt the team".

Core hours of 11:00 am to 3:00 pm are required as part of a flexible working hours request. Please note that where every effort will be made to accommodate the request for flexible hours and granted flexible hour schedules, client and/or internal meetings will supersede these scheduling exceptions. 

For customer service and security reasons, the office policy requires that 2 people be in the office at all times during core hours. Additionaly, there must be one person from each client-facing Pod. Please schedule your hours, meals, and breaks accordingly.

### Attendance

Much of our work is interdependent on others so being ready for work at your desk at your appointed time is expected. Punctuality reflects a positive interest and attitude toward your job. Habitually arriving late for work is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action.


### Guidelines

If you’re going to be late for work, you must notify your manager as soon as possible or by no later than 9:00 a.m. or earlier if your flexible time starts earlier.
Absence due to tardiness must be made up outside of working hours. These hours must be approved by management beforehand so as not to compromise workflow.
You must notify your manager about time required for personal appointments (e.g. doctor, dentist) at least 48 hours prior to the time to be missed. Such appointments should be made at the beginning or end of the day whenever possible to minimize the impact on Treefrog’s workflow. Excused time for such personal appointments must be made up and these hours must be approved by management beforehand so as not to compromise workflow.

### Exempt and Non-Exempt

Exempt Frogs hold positions that are managerial in nature. These Frogs are exempt from the hours of work and overtime provisions. Information Technology is an industry that falls under a “special rule” and Frogs working in this sector are also exempt from the above provisions. Non- exempt Frogs are those Frogs holding positions that are not managerial in nature. Non-exempt Frogs are subject to the hours of work, rest periods, and overtime provisions.

### Minimum/Maximum Weekly Hours

Our company has a higher than average minimum expectation of 40 hours of work a week. Most companies expect you to be on site for 40 hours a week (the old 9-5 rule), and then give you paid time for lunch and breaks.

Treefog does not pay for breaks or lunch. You are "legally obligated" to take a lunch break for a minimum of 30 mins and two breaks for 15 minutes. Therefore, you are theoretically obligated to stay onsite at least 9 hours a working day. However, since we usually talk about work during lunch, and/or eating at our desks since there are no physically demanding roles that require physical rest, the suggestion is, if you wish, you may multi-task your lunch break to continue specific work-related discussions and thus combine lunch and work. Talking about people who work here is not a work related discussion. Talking about a project is a work related discussion.

On the other end, as a salaried employee, you cannot work more than a maximum of 48 hours a week. We do not pay overtime for work over 48 hours You are all salaried and thus the expectation is that everyone works between 40-44, max 48, hours a week in return for the value of their salary. Also, you must take 11 hours off consecutively each day, you must take 8 hours of rest in between "shifts", and you must take 24 hours a week to rest.

The exception to this rule is if there are "exceptional circumstances" i.e. an "emergency". An "emergency" qualifies as something unforeseen that interrupts one of the processes of our business:

- Equipment or Software failures that affect the business
- Your computer fails - hardware or software
- The phone system fails
- A server goes down
- A website stops functioning
- Weather related issues, for example, power outage, we do not pay for you to sit around during one if your computer isn't working or cannot make it to work due to snow.

In these cases, if an emergency happens, you can work up to a maximum of 60 hours a week. In other words, if the file system stops working, as a salaried employee, you are not theoretically paid for the time you cannot do your work. This time is the result of an unforseen emergency, and you will need to make sure you still get your 40 hours of work in. There is no "overtime pay". We are all in it together. We are all managing our own time, managing our own fates, and we all have to put in extra if there is a failure in the system we have created and we support.

Also note, in this case, you cannot work more than 60 hours a week. If you do this, you will eventually kill yourself and that is not good for anyone. This has only happened a few times with people in non-emergency scenarios and it has prompted a discussion in every case.

Also, if you end up intentionally working until 4 in the morning (Eric!), you should not really come in for 8 hours, menaing, noon the next day. If it is an emergency, this may not qualify, but it is fair logic. To clarify, intentionally is being defined as the result of planned and required late-night work, not because you want to complete something and cannot sleep until you do. 

Please adjust your thinking if you are already not thinking this way. Everyone on the team is a salaried employee, and everyone is responsible for doing his or her part to keep the boat floating.

### Home Hours

Bottom line, working from home is a mixed bag of value. Although you may be more efficient at home to accomplish specific tasks, the overall effect on communication, access to correct resources, confusion by others, other's need to take on additional responsibilities when you are not available, and so on, can impact overall team productivity and our potential combined success.

We are much more efficient if we are all working together in this space. We are going to redefine the "rules" around working from home in the coming months to protect our future.

### Time VS Energy

This whole discussion above is pretty stupid and for most people, at most times, is somewhat redundant. At the end of the day, all of this is, "I have a job rhetoric", not, "glorious success and happiness for all involved on the team rhetoric". The fact is, we all go through periods of energy and burnout. We all have weeks we need to take it easy and weeks we are passionately engaged to achieve more.

This is merely a framework for everyone to understand the basic minimum expectations so you know when you are on side or off side and the amount of work you put in for the group to be successful. We also "pay" for learning time,fun time, and growing time. It is not intended to be Draconian, but rather, to make sure we are all pulling forward and not just dropping your paddle in the water and riding on other's effort. The expectation is that everyone works harder than the average person elsewhere. We are Frog.

Do not do less than 40 hours of work. If you are over 44 hours, you probably need to have your role reevaluated. If emergencies are keeping us awake every night and we are working 60 hours, we should rethink the whole shebang and go into landscaping or sulphur mining instead of web development, programming and hosting.

### Discretionary Effort and the Individual Effect

We are in a very tight spot financially due to all of the wicked-cool stuff that is going on at Treefrog. We need to maximize our cash flow throughout the summer and get "extra" stuff done to ensure we all sail out of the muck together and have each other's backs. We are Frogs for Life, and we need to keep our socks pulled up.

Now, let's do some quick math.

If everyone works 1 extra minute a day, let's say content inputting because everyone can do it, is the equivalent of 25 minutes a day or 2.5 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production minute, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months /60mins);

1 Minute a Day = $1128/month = $13,541/year

ONE minute of extra paid work by everyone pays for a 100MB fiber connection.

If everyone works 1 extra hour a day, let's say content inputting because everyone can do it, is the equivalent of 25 hours a day or 125 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production hour, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months);

1 Hour a Day = $67,708/month in Productivity = $812,500/year (half our current revenue)

Another way to look at this is if we lose 1 hour of work due to an Internet failure, or we work 39 hours a week instead of 40, or an emergency server issue costs us an evening of grief, we are cutting off our opportunity to grow and succeed. Working less than 40 hours is stealing from our potential success.

That little extra bit of time, and/or effort, is the difference of getting us up to the next level, getting us into position to give out raises, or putting us in a position to hire more help to take stress away from you.

Here are some interesting facts and effects I've never mentioned, but as a matter of transparency, I am sharing. (These aren't rules, but rules of thumb):

- If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. I question, if I am paying you enough at your current value, why this is happening, and how do we fix it.
- If FrogWeb shows you below 40 hours of work in a trailing quarter, I see red flags and do not consider you for the hour of time on my part to dig into your time expenditure and overall contribution to the team to consider you for a raise. Other people get the conversation first. I consider your fewer hours of negative value as equivalent to an unrealized cash bonus you have self-assigned.
- Depending on your role, if FrogWeb shows more than 2-3 hours a week of "Admin" time over and above your 40 hours and your role does not necessitate this by definition, I see red flags. You are possibly putting time in for stuff you should not like "computer failure", "lunch", "an error on a specific site I should have fixed", or "cleaning up after a client when I should have billed it under a project". It makes me ask questions of you in my head about how you are using FrogWeb and what you are hiding. You can and should track this stuff under Admin but it should balance out to some degree with work and/or 40+ hours. You should be raising the flag that your computer is not working properly and/or trying to do something else effective, not sitting around burning admin time twiddling your thumbs.
- We support the flexibility of going and getting your license renewed or your teeth cleaned during the day so you do not have to do it on your weekend which is stupid. But if you do not catch up on the time in a meaningful way, you are hurting the person sitting next to you by not carrying your weight.

Again, this is not a call to work hours of free overtime. I would rather you worked 40 hours exactly every week but maintained a critical and meaningful focus, accomplishing error-free and client-loving work, and kept your energy intact. However, please do not watch the clock but watch the team and our future, and be wary that excessive admin time, an emergency scenario, server failure, computer failure, or abuse of the unique flexibility we offer, can threaten our very existence by taking away from our forward momentum. We have to rise above these issues if we are to succeed.

One last point, if we spent an extra 10 minutes every day, right at the moment we were going to leave, working on Treefrog itself, website/social/etc., we would be adding thousands of dollars in marketing value to our company as a whole.
