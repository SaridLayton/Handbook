# Housekeeping

> If you make a mess, clean it up.

Please ensure you clean up after yourselves in order to maintain the space for everyone to enjoy.

What you dirty, wash and dry. What you spill, wipe up. What you put in the fridge, eat or take home again. You are responsible for your own space.

### Desk Cleanliness

We should really do something about desks. Specifically, Sean's.

**UPDATE**: we stuffed him in a room where his desk isn't easily visible. Problem solved.
