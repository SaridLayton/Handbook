# Vacations

> Think about the Frogs before you book. Don't be selfish.

Vacations will be allotted on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to Treefrogâ€™s approval. All vacation requests must be submitted via the vacation system at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the vacation time. Treefrog has the sole discretion to approve or decline the requested vacation dates, based on the impact to company deliverables.

By law, Frogs must take a minimum of 5 consecutive days vacation in any calendar year. The remainder of the allotted vacation days may be taken in subsequent requests consisting of (but not limited to) shorter periods.

Frogs should also NOT take more than 5 consecutive days if possible, to minimize the exhaustion of other team members supporting their absence. Holidays over 5 days should be discussed in detail with your Pod leader before approval.

If circumstances require you to cancel the already approved vacation time, Treefrog has the sole discretion to approve/decline the change in vacation dates.

### Carry Over Time

You should take vacation days during the calendar year in which it is earned. However, unused vacation days may be carried over so that an employee may have a maximum of one additional week (more than they are entitled too) in any one year.

1. Permission to carry over any unused vacation time must be requested prior to the start of a new calendar year.
2. Should a Frog carry over vacation time from one year to the next, at the time permission is requested to carry such time over, the Frog must provide Treefrog with a timeframe as to when said vacation time shall be used.
3. Pay in lieu of unused vacation will not be offered, except as required by law under termination circumstances. If you don't take your holidays and then cease to be employed by Treefrog, you don't get paid out for your holiday.

You are responsible to schedule your own holidays. If you feel pressured by Treefrog in any way to *not* take your holiday, please send it in writing directly to the CEO, who will help you manage it accordingly. Everybody needs a break.
### Amount of Holiday

During the first three years of continuous service at Treefrog, Frogs will be eligible for two weeks (ten working days) paid vacation per year.

During the first six (6) months of continuous service for new employees, no vacation time will be granted. However, during the first year of service, vacation time accrues on the basis of 5/6 day vacation for each month of service. Therefore, after the initial six months, an employee is eligible for five (5) days vacation (5/6 x 6 = 5 days) with an additional 5/6 day per month accrued thereafter until the maximum (10 days) is achieved.

 | **Years of Service** | **Annual Vacation Amount** | **Annual Vacation Time** |
 | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
 | 1 to 3 years         | Paid Salary                | 10 days                  |
 | 3 to 10 years        | Paid Salary                | 15 days                  |
 | 10 to 20 years       | Paid Salary                | 20 days                  |


#### When will I be eligible to receive holiday pay?

Frogs will receive payment for holidays by calculating all of the "regular wages the Frog earned" and all of the "vacation pay that was payable" to the Frog in the four weeks ending just before the work week that includes the holiday. This total amount is divided by 20 to determine the amount of holiday pay the Frog will receive.

### Vacation Calendar

Vacation requests are to be logged in the holiday system (http://holidays.treefrog.ca). Everyone can see a full calendar with all Frogs' time that has been booked off tentatively (orange), and approved (green). You must go into the calendar and select the time off you are requesting. Your Champion will view your request and approve or decline your request based on staffing and company deliverables. All vacation requests must be submitted in the tracking system at least 2 weeks prior to the start of your request.

### Special Holidays: Education Days

Some Frogs hired from other companies who already had earned holidays through longevity with their previous company are granted (through pre-hired negotiation) an additonal five days off for educational purposes in lieu of holidays. Unlike conferences, etc., the Frog is not required to be doing anything specific during this period, but is expected to use this time for self-education. It is, however, expected that the Frog is available via phone for emergencies during these periods and additionally self-educates (by reading, videos, training, etc.) during these five days.

After three years, these holidays become regular holiday days - they do not get appended, but resolved into the regular calendar.

On termination of employment, "holiday days" accrued as "education days" are not payable.

These days are not for public discussion and may only be granted by the CEO during initial contractual negotiation before starting at Treefrog.


### Champion Pod Members

As [pod-champions](manual/pod-champions.md) are members of two pods (their own, and the Champion Pod), their time must be cognizant of the scheduling of both Pods. Ergo - Pod Champions set their own holidays, but are expected to make sure their own pod bases are covered in case of sickness/etc. and additionally be available for all Champion activities.
