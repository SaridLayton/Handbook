# Introduction

Welcome to the Treefrog Handbook!

This handbook is designed to replace the classic (and legally required) "employee manual" provided by most companies. However, as per the Treefrog way, this handbook is designed to be <b>an oblique solution to a necessary problem</b>: getting everyone on the same page and rowing in the same direction, without the Damoclean Sword of draconian bureaucracy preventing our overall and individual creativity and ultimate success.

Ergo, <b>these set of documents are open for any Frog to improve and make recommendations</b>, openly and productively, using GitHub as a collaborative technology.


###Organization

This manual is organized into two parts: the "why", and the "how". Initially, the "why" (aka "First Principles") are the guiding principles of how and why we have chosen to build the company. The "how" (the "Manual") includes the rules and boundaries of working at Treefrog, that all Frogs are obligated to follow. <b>We are what we tolerate.</b>

Each section of the "Manual" is composed of more than just "the rules" - but rather with a "spirit", a "simple acid test hard rule", and with detailed examples of interpretation and examples of how this rule came to exist.

1. First Principles (The Way of the Frog)
	* [The Sacred Cow Principle](First Principles/TheCowPrinciple.md)
2. Manual


###Suggestions and Edits

As every Frog is required to read and agree to everything in this document, every Frog should be able to bring any issues/clarification/improvment/addition they see fit to the table. <i>Just because you think it is right</i> doesn't mean we are obligated to add it to the manual: this document is a living document that intends to define the best possible way for Treefrog to be a principled business that genuinely makes the world a better place. 

It is not a mechanism designed to appease everyone's entitlements, but rather give us a unified and collaborative metholodogy by which to constantly improve, as is the Way of the Frog.


###Last Official Version

> Employee Manual 2009

The last "Official Version" is the one which all Frogs are required to sign and adhere to. As we change these policies - especially given all Frogs have access to and are encouraged to challenge and improve these policies - we will "crystalize" a new version which every employee of Treefrog is required to adhere to from the moment they are crystalized.*

*This also means you will be given reasonable warning when a "final version" has been crystalized - just like software!
