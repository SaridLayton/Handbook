# Dress

> Preferably, wear clothes.

(Try to use common sense. If someone gets insulted, we are going to have to have a big long section here.)

#### Philosophy

Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. The way you dress will affect other people's opinions of you - both other Frogs and clients alike.

#### Wearing Green

If you wear green, we will pay you $1/day.

The rules to collect your money:

1. Only 1$/day
2. Frogs are monitored monthly and will get tallied at the end of the month.
3. Clients get a loonie from accounting.
4. You must actually come to a Treefrog office to collect. Working from home in green pyjamas does not count.
5. The item must be an article of clothing or jewelry and must be WORN and immediately recognizable as green. Purses, folders, bags, some grass, does not count. Unless it is really cool.
6. The same item may not be worn the same way on two consecutive days.
7. The item must be visible. It can be your underwear, if they are worn Superman style.
8. Khaki isn't green, it's Khaki. Treefrog green is the ideal. Don't be a green faker.
9. To collect your dollar, you must send a picture of yourself wearing green to green@treefrog.ca. These pictures will be displayed on the Treefrog site so please do not make inappropriate gestures. Frogs will take pictures of clients for the client to collect. (name as title of the email)
10. There will be a monthly prize for the individual who consistently wears green the most. Note that you may wear green offsite and send in to Treefrog to win this prize even if you do not come locally to collect your buck.
