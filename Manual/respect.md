# Respect

### Employee Relations

Treefrog is committed to providing fair policies and procedures in order to foster employee engagement and commitment and to minimize complaints and morale problems. To accomplish this, Treefrog will strive to build an effective two-way communication system, implement fair treatment and discipline procedures, and protect Frogs' privacy. Part of this commitment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere where any problem, complaint, suggestion, or question receives a timely response. Everyone is expected to treat each other with mutual respect. Frogs are encouraged to offer positive and constructive criticism. If Frogs disagree with the established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, they can express their concern through the problem resolution procedure. No Frog will be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a complaint with management in a reasonable, businesslike manner or for using the problem resolution procedure.

### Open Door Program

If a situation occurs where a Frog believes that a condition of employment or a decision affecting him or her is unjust or inequitable, he or she is encouraged to make use of the following steps: 

**Step 1**: The Frog presents the problem to the CEO in writing after the incident occurs.

**Step 2**: The CEO has 5 days to respond to the problem presented by the Frog. The CEO’s response must be in writing since the problem needs to be documented and must indicate the CEO's decision and the reason for the decision.

**Step 3**: If after step 2, the Frog is dissatisfied with the decision, the Frog may go to HR Performance & Results, a 3rd party Human Resources Department. HRPAR has 5 days to respond to the problem presented by the Frog. The response must be in writing since the problem needs to be documented and must indicate the decision of HRPAR and the reason for the decision.

The Frog may discontinue the procedure at any step along the way.

Not every problem can be resolved to everyone’s total satisfaction. It is only through understanding and discussion of mutual problems for everyone that we develop confidence and trust in each other. This confidence and trust is important to the operation’s efficient and harmonious work environment.
