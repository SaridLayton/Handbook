# Overtime

> Consistently working more than 44 hours a week will cause you to burnout and that is not in the best interests for you or Treefrog.

In accordance with the [Ontario Employment Standards Act](http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/010285), [Information Technology Professionals](Information Technology Professionals), and managers ([Pod Champions] (Pod Champions)), everyone in the company unless explicitly identified, is not entitled to overtime pay.

Administration (ie. reception) or any other non-IT or non-managerial position are eligible for overtime pay at a rate of 1 1/2 times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 44 hours per week.  Please refer to the section on "exempt vs. non-exempt frogs" for further clarification on overtime eligibility. 

**Overtime must be approved by the CEO.** 

Positions that are not IT or managerial in nature are potentially eligible for overtime pay. This must be clearly agreed upon in advance and in writing and should not be regarded as the default. Roles explicitly identified for overtime pay would not be salaried and would have a lot less flexibility than currently available to regular Frogs.


If you are working overtime, it is likely a symptom of poor role fit, lack of experience, or emergency situation(s), rather than excessive amounts of work. As Treefrog allows most roles a significantly high degree of flexibility, it is expected that if you cannot do your job within the regular work week hours, you will make arrangements with Treefrog leadership to provide you with additional training for efficiency, support, or redefinition of your role to ensure you can complete your work in an appropriate work day.

For the purposes of calculating overtime, only **working hours**, including training time (ie. orientation), are calculated.  However, some time at Treefrog may not be considered "paid work"  especially when you are participating in extracurricular activities . Although these are, in general, counted in your [Frogweb](manual/Frogweb) tracking, they do not qualify as foundational hours where you would be additionally compensated.  Travel time or training time outside of normal working hours will not be included.  Other time off such as emergency leave days, will not be considered as time worked for the purposes of computing overtime. 
 
Additionally, some time at Treefrog may not be considered "paid work",  especially when you are participating in extracurricular activities and/or learning opportunities. Although these are, in general, counted in your [Frogweb](timekeeping.md) tracking, they do not qualify as foundational hours where you would be additionally compensated.

*If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. Together, we will figure out how to fix it.*
