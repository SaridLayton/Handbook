# Overtime

> Consistently working more than 44 hours a week will cause you to burnout and that is not in the best interests for you or Treefrog.

In accordance with the [Ontario Employment Standards Act](http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/010285), [Information Technology Professionals](Information Technology Professionals) and managers ([Pod Champions](Pod Champions)) (i.e. everyone in the company unless explicitly identified*)  are not entitled to overtime pay.

Positions that are not IT or managerial in nature are potentially eligible for overtime pay but this must be clearly agreed on in advance and in writing and should not be regarded as the default. Roles explicitly identified for overtime pay would not be salaried, have flexible hours, etc. and would have much less flexibility than currently available to regular Frogs.

If you are working overtime, it is likely a symptom of poor role fit and/or lack of experience (or an/multiple emergency situation(s)), not excessive amounts of work. As Treefrog allows most roles a significantly high degree of flexibility, it is expected that if you cannot do your job within the regular work week hours, you make arrangements with Treefrog leadership to provide you with additional training for efficiency, support, or redefinition of your role, to ensure you can complete your work in an appropriate work day.

Additionally, some time at Treefrog may not be considered "paid work"  especially when you are participating in extracurricular activities and or learning opportunities. Although these are, in general, counted in your [Frogweb](manual/Frogweb) tracking, they do not qualify as foundational hours where you would be additionally compensated.

*If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. Together, we will figure out how to fix it.*
