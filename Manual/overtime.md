# Overtime

> Don't ever work more than 44 hours a week on average. We do not pay overtime.

*Consistently working more than 44 hours a week will cause you to burnout and that is not in the best interest of you, your teammates or Treefrog.*

All Frogs are expected to work between 40 and 44 hours per week per week in return for the value of their salary.  Frogs are not permitted to unilaterally work beyond their regular work hours without prior approval from the CEO. 

ESA regulations clearly state Treefrog is obligated to pay overtime for any hour over 44 hours worked every week by [Non-Exempt](Manual/Exempted.md) Frogs. However, our salaried, flexible, managed work environment (with very few punishments for missing deadlines or leaving early to go to the Doctor and lots of internal fun-time) has no reason to compel you to *ever* work more than an average of 44 billable hours a week unless all hell has broken loose. Ergo, as a rule, we don't pay overtime - not in defiance of ESA - but because it shouldn't ever happen as a matter of your health and our working framework for ensuring this.

([ESA Overtime Guidelines](https://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/overtime.php) for more details)

If you have **billed** over **44 hours** for **over three weeks in a row**, you should speak to the CEO immediately to ensure you are in compliance with our maximum average weekly hourly work week of 44 hours. You shouldn't be doing this, and we should be re-thinking some things.

Technically, authorized hours worked in excess of 44 hours in any week will be paid at a rate of 1.5 times the regular rate for all [non-exempt](Manual/Exempted.md) Frogs.  A (non-exempt) Frog who works beyond forty-four (44) hours in a work week without prior authorization obtained in advance, is in violation of our policies, so they will be paid and then reviewed for going against our policy.

*[Bounties](Manual/Boutnies.md) do not qualify for overtime pay, as they are all by choice and have their own payment terms attached.

#### Additional Clarifications on Overtime Calculations

> Many Frogs are Exempt, anyway

- Many people at Treefrog to not qualify for overtime anyway under ESA regulations. You can check if you qualify for overtime hours here: [Exempted Frogs](Manual/Exempt.md). The rule of thumb is, if you are in IT or have "Manager" in your title, you are exempted.

> Not all Frogweb Hours are actually Paid Hours

- Hours only count as "paid hours" if you are **obligated** to be there or do them. Team building days, client lunches, Pod training, most events, self-learning, Learn O'Clock and most administration time is all "by choice only", and therefore does not count towards "overtime hours" (as proven by the very rare occurence of all Frogs attending without punitive measures being taken). As all other hours should be billable against a client, only billable hours count towards your "overtime calculations".

> This is a Salaried environment, not an Hourly one. It's up to you to self-manage with common sense.

- By accepting a contract with flexible hours and a salaried role, you agree to average your hours over several weeks at a time, as per ESA regulations. We don't dock your pay if you are short of your 40 hour obligations. But in return, you don't get paid the weeks you work over this, either. This is consistent with the ideals of work-life balance at Treefrog.

> If you wanna look back, let's look back to the letter of the law.

- Should you wish to recieve overtime pay retroactively, Treefrog reserves the right to retroactively review all previous hours you have worked with the company and *not* pay you for hours under 40 hours.

> Working over 44 hours a week regularly? 

- If Frog counts you working more than 44 hours a week, it is likely a symptom of poor role fit, lack of experience, or emergency situation(s), rather than excessive amounts of work. As Treefrog allows most roles a significantly high degree of flexibility, it is expected that if you cannot do your job within the regular work week hours, you will make arrangements with Treefrog leadership to provide you with additional training for efficiency, support, or redefinition of your role to ensure you can complete your work in an appropriate work day.

*If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. Together, we will figure out how to fix it.*

*YOU are obligated to make sure this happens, not anyone else. If you feel you are being inappropriately obligated to work overtime, please speak to the CEO at once.*

### Rationale

The whole discussion above is pretty stupid and for most people, at most times, is somewhat redundant. At the end of the day, all of this is: "I have a job" rhetoric, not, "glorious success and happiness for all involved on the team through the mutual sharing of energy when we have it" rhetoric. The fact is we all go through periods of energy and burnout. We all have weeks we need to take it easy and weeks we are passionately engaged to achieve more. We should be cognizant of these ebbs and flows of one another's energy as a team.
