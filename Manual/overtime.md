# Overtime

> Don't ever work more than 44 hours a week on average. We do not pay overtime.

*Consistently working more than 44 hours a week will cause you to burnout and that is not in the best interest of you, your teammates or Treefrog.*

Despite the clear ESA regulations surrounding Treefog's obligation to pay overtime for any hour over 44 hours worked every week ([ESA Overtime Guidelines](https://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/overtime.php)), our salaried, flexible, managed work environment (with very few punishments for missing deadlines) has no reason to compel you to *ever* work more than an average of 44 billable hours a week unless all hell has broken loose. Ergo, we don't pay overtime, cause it shouldn't ever happen.

If you have **billed** over **44 hours** for **over three weeks in a row**, you should speak to the CEO immediately to ensure you are in compliance with our maximum average weekly hourly work week of 44 hours.

All Frogs are expected to work between 40 and 44 hours per week per week in return for the value of their salary.  Frogs are not permitted to unilaterally work beyond their regular work hours without prior approval from the CEO. 

Technically, authorized hours worked in excess of 44 hours in any week will be paid at a rate of 1.5 times the regular rate for all non-exempt Frogs.  A (non-exempt) Frog who works beyond forty-four (44) hours in a work week without prior authorization obtained in advance, is in violation of our policies.

#### Additional Clarifications on Overtime Calculations

- Many people at Treefrog (e.g. IT, leadership) to not qualify for overtime anyway under ESA regulations. You can check if you qualify for overtime hours here [exempt here](Manual/Exempt.md).

- Hours only count as "paid hours" if you are *obligated* to be there or do them. Team building days, Pod training, most events, self-learning, Learn O'Clock and most administration time is all "by interest only", and therefore does not count towards "overtime hours". As all other hours should be billable against a client, only billable hours count towards your "overtime calculations".

- By accepting a contract with flexible hours and a salaried role, you agree to average your hours over several weeks at a time, as per ESA regulations. We don't dock your pay if you are short of your 40 hour obligation. But in return, you don't get paid the weeks you work over this, either.

- Should you wish to recieve overtime pay, Treefrog reserves the right to retroactively review all previous hours you have worked with the company and *not* pay you for hours under 40 hours.

** Working over 44 hours a week regularly?** 

If you are working overtime, it is likely a symptom of poor role fit, lack of experience, or emergency situation(s), rather than excessive amounts of work. As Treefrog allows most roles a significantly high degree of flexibility, it is expected that if you cannot do your job within the regular work week hours, you will make arrangements with Treefrog leadership to provide you with additional training for efficiency, support, or redefinition of your role to ensure you can complete your work in an appropriate work day.

For the purposes of calculating overtime, only **working hours**, including training time (ie. orientation), are calculated.  However, some time at Treefrog may not be considered "paid work"  especially when you are participating in extracurricular activities . Although these are, in general, counted in your [Frogweb](manual/Frogweb) tracking, they do not qualify as foundational hours where you would be additionally compensated.  Travel time or training time outside of normal working hours will not be included.  Other time off such as emergency leave days, will not be considered as time worked for the purposes of computing overtime. 
 
Additionally, some time at Treefrog may not be considered "paid work",  especially when you are participating in extracurricular activities and/or learning opportunities. Although these are, in general, counted in your [Frogweb](timekeeping.md) tracking, they do not qualify as foundational hours where you would be additionally compensated.

*If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. Together, we will figure out how to fix it.*

*YOU are obligated to make sure this happens, not anyone else. If you feel you are being inappropriately obligated to work overtime, please speak to the CEO at once.*

### Time vs. Energy

The whole discussion above is pretty stupid and for most people, at most times, is somewhat redundant. At the end of the day, all of this is: "I have a job" rhetoric, not, "glorious success and happiness for all involved on the team" rhetoric. The fact is we all go through periods of energy and burnout. We all have weeks we need to take it easy and weeks we are passionately engaged to achieve more.

This is merely a framework for everyone to understand the basic minimum expectations so that you know when you are "onside" or "offside", and the amount of work you need to put in for the group to be successful. We also "track time" for learning time, fun time, and growing time, and consider these. This is not intended to be Draconian, but rather, to make sure we are all pulling forward and not just dropping our paddles in the water and riding on the efforts of others. The expectation is that everyone works harder than the average person elsewhere. We are Frogs.

Do not do less than 40 hours of work. If you are over 44 hours, you probably need to have your role reevaluated. If emergencies are keeping us awake every night and we are working 60 hours, we should rethink the whole shebang and go into landscaping or sulphur mining instead of web development, programming, and hosting.

### Discretionary Effort and the Individual Effect

Now, let us do some quick math:

When 25 Frogs work 1 extra minute a day, let us say content inputting because everyone can do that, this is the equivalent of 25 minutes a day or 2.5 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production minute, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months /60mins);

1 Minute a Day = $1128/month = $13,541/year

ONE minute of extra paid work by 25 Frogs pays for a 100MB fiber connection.

When 25 Frogs work 1 extra hour a day, let us again say content inputting because everyone can do that, this is the equivalent of 25 hours a day or 125 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production hour, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months);

1 Hour a Day = $67,708/month in Productivity = $812,500/year (half our current revenue)

Another way to look at this is if we lose 1 hour of work due to an Internet failure, or we work 39 hours a week instead of 40, or an emergency server issue costs us an evening of grief, we are cutting off our opportunity to grow and succeed. Working less than 40 hours is stealing from our potential success.

That little extra bit of time and/or effort is the difference of getting us to the next level, getting us into position to give out raises, or putting us in a position to hire more help to take stress away from you.

Here are some interesting facts and effects that have never been mentioned, but as a matter of transparency, are now being shared. (These are not rules, but rules of thumb):

- If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. This begs the question that if you are being payed appropriately at your current value, why this is happening, and what do we do to fix it.
- If FrogWeb shows you below 40 hours of work in a trailing quarter, there are red flags. You will not even be considered for a raise for the hour of time required to dig into your time expenditure and overall contribution to the team. Other people get the conversation first. I consider your fewer hours of negative value as equivalent to an unrealized cash bonus you have self-assigned.
- Depending on your role, if FrogWeb shows more than 2-3 hours a week of "Admin" time over and above your 40 hours, and your role does not necessitate this by definition, there are red flags. You are possibly putting time in for work that you should not; such as, "computer failure", "lunch", "an error on a specific site [you] should have fixed", or "cleaning up after a client when [you] should have billed it under a project". Questions are raised about how you are using FrogWeb and what you are hiding. You can and should track this type of activity under Admin, and your activity should balance out to some degree with work and/or 40+ hours. If your computer is not working properly, you should be trying to do other work that is effective rather than sitting around twiddling your thumbs burning admin time. 
- We support the flexibility of going and getting your license renewed or your teeth cleaned during the day so that you do not have to on your weekend - that is stupid. If you do not catch up on the time in a meaningful way, however, you are hurting the person sitting next to you by not carrying your weight.

Again, this is not a call to work hours of free overtime. It would be preferable for you to work exactly 40 hours every week and maintain a critical and meaningful focus, accomplishing error-free and client-loving work, and keep your energy intact. However, please do not watch the clock - watch the team and our future. Be wary that excessive admin time, an emergency scenario, server failure, computer failure, or abuse of the unique flexibility we offer can threaten our very existence by taking away from our forward momentum. We have to rise above these issues if we are to succeed.

One last point, if we spent an extra 10 minutes every day, right at the moment we were going to leave, working on Treefrog itself, website/social/etc., we would be adding thousands of dollars in marketing value to our company as a whole.
