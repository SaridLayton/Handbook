# Pregnancy Leave

> Take some time to enjoy your new kid.

Treefrog provides pregnancy leaves of absence without pay to all eligible Frogs according to the guidelines set out in Ontarioâ€™s Employment Standards Act. A Frog is entitled to 17 weeks of unpaid leave of absence for pregnancy if the Frog has been employed by Treefrog for at least 13 weeks preceding the expected date of delivery. Any Frog entitled to the leave must give notice in writing to the CEO at least 2 weeks prior to the date the leave is to begin, but the more notice the better.

We are cognizant that pregnancy and child-bearing is a beautiful, natural, and important process, and we want to work together with you to ensure the child is cared for appropriately. Different newborns and different parents have different needs. Let us work through this together.

> The kid makes the rules, not you. Keep us in the loop!

Also note that we are aware that, under most circumstances, the complexities of child birth and return-to-work dynamics are often filled with twists and turns - and the more Treefrog knows about your twists and turns, the more we can be adquately prepared for your return. Stay in touch!
