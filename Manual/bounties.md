# Bounties & Special Projects

> If you need extra cash, Treefrog will try and help you.

<i>Everyone needs a little cash now and then. Ideally, we have enough extra revenue to afford to have you do out-of-phase projects that benefit Treefrog using your skills, instead of you getting a 2nd job to stay alive.</i> 

Treefrog allows for after-hours work to be done by Frogs in order to collect rewards. These bounties are subject to change.

###Current Bounties Available

1. **SmartServe** - SmartServe certification is open to everyone.
2. **Google Certifification** - 

Bounties are only paid out if you do these things on your own time.

If your role at Treefrog requires that the goals of these bounties need to be completed anyway, 

### Special Projects

You can work an additional project after hours under certain circumstances.
