# Expenses

> If Treefrog should have paid for it, we will reimburse you.

Once a month, if you have appropriate expenses, you should submit a report to the controller for reimbursement from Treefrog.

1. Expense reports must be completed and forwarded to the Controller.
2. Original receipts must be submitted as attachments to the expense report.
3. Expense reports must be filled out for anything charged to a company credit card.
4. Expense reports for non-trivial amounts, over $100 or single amounts, must be signed off on by the CEO.

Expenses are paid within 30 days of submission of an approved expense report.

If you fail to sumbit an expense report within 30 days of its due date, you are totally screwing up our financial statements and causing us an administrative headache. Therefore, we are not obligated to pay your expenses if you submit them over 30 days after they were incurred.

#### Mileage

Frogs are eligible to claim mileage expenses only when they are requested by Treefrog to travel in excess of 35 km from the office for business purposes. Mileage will not be granted for travel to and from work. The following guidelines are to be followed to claim mileage and other company related expenses:

1. You must request access to a vehicle first. We may have one for you to borrow.
2. Mileage must be calculated from the work site as the starting point.
3. Mileage is paid at $.52/km and is subject to change without notice.

#### Phone Expenses

Frogs whose roles require them to have phones will be reimbursed for phone charges.
