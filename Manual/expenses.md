# Expenses

> If Treefrog should have paid for it, we will reimburse you.

*It makes sense that if you would not have bought or done it as a result of your job at Treefrog, and Treefrog is the sole benefactor of your purchase, Treefrog should be paying for it. However, this "common sense rule" can lead to a myriad of interpretations based on many dynamic factors. Think of it this way: if Treefrog is the exclusive benefactor of your purchase, you shouldn't be paying for it, Treefrog should. If Treefrog can't afford to pay these expenses, we shouldn't be in business.*

These policies and procedures are designed to act as a guideline for all Treefrog expenses. While this handbook does contain suggested expense limits, all Frogs should use professional judgment when incurring expenses on behalf of the Company. Treefrog recognizes that, in some isolated cases, business related expenses might need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis; however, this primarily applies if the expense in question was not discussed in this policy.

This policy is designed to accomplish the following key points: 

- Ensure all Frogs have a clear and consistent understanding of policies and procedures for business travel and expenses.
- Ensure Frogs are reimbursed for legitimate business travel and entertainment expenses.

Once a month, if you have appropriate expenses, you should submit an expense report to the Controller for reimbursement from Treefrog. 

When submitting expenses:

1. Expense reports must be completed, approved by your Pod Leader and forwarded to the Controller.
2. Original receipts must be submitted as attachments to the expense report.  If an itemized receipt is missing, the Frog should contact the vendor to obtain one. This is your job, not the Controller's.
3. Expense reports must be filled out for anything charged to a company credit card.
4. Expenses are paid within 30 days of submission of an approved expense report, within reason.
5. Expenses must be claimed within 30 days. If expenses are not claimed within 30 days, no matter how small, they require CEO sign-off.
6. Expense reports for non-trivial amounts or irregular amounts must be signed off by the CEO. *Use your common sense judgement when interpreting this.*

If you fail to submit an expense report within 30 days of its due date, you are totally screwing up our financial statements and causing us an administrative headache. Therefore, we are not obligated to pay your expenses if you submit them over 30 days after they were incurred. You are making everyone's life miserable.

### Mileage

> Mileage is not a way for you to pad your salary. It is 
> a way for us to make sure you are adequately compensated for wear
> and tear on your vehicle where an alternative transportation method cannot be provided for you. 

Frogs are eligible to claim mileage expenses only when they have been required by Treefrog to travel more than 35 km from the office for business purposes. *This is an industry standard rule and prevents us from dying from a thousand administrative papercuts.*

Mileage will not be granted for travel to and from work. Obviously. Move closer to your work, already.

The following guidelines are to be followed to claim mileage and other company related expenses:

1. You must request access to a vehicle first. We will try to have one for you to borrow that matches our brand and philosophies.
2. Mileage must be calculated from the work site as the starting point.

If travelling **less than 85 km round trip**, please try to use the electric car (for obvious environmental reasons), and if it’s not available, then request a rental car to be booked through  Client Care.  If you chose to use your own vehicle, Treefrog will pay a maximum of the cost of a rental car (roughly $45, subject to change), or $.52/km, whichever is **lower**.

If travelling more than 85 km round trip, please try to use the electric car, and if it’s not available, then request a rental car to be booked ([Client Care] (aka reception), handles this).  If you chose to use your own vehicle, Treefrog will pay a maximum of $45, since that would be the cost of a rental.

Frogs may use their personal vehicle for business purposes if it is less expensive than renting a car, taking a taxi, or using alternate transportation, and **your car represents Treefrog's brand accordingly**. Otherwise, you are taking advantage of Treefrog for your own gain or representing our team incorrectly. *Use your common sense judgement when interpreting this: as in, the amount you are billing for mileage shouldn't exceed what you are paying for your car.*

If you are using your own vehicle for business purposes, Treefrog will pay up to a maximum of $100/week for all travel expenses. Because if this is a regular thing, we should be coming up with an alternative travel mechanism for you - like leasing another car. Treefrog  should not be paying your car lease.

If you are regularly driving to a specific client far away, the cost of your mileage should be an additional charge to the client. It is your responsibility to ensure this happens, as others may not be aware of this happening.

If you are planning a trip to a client's location and then plan to carry on from there to a place for your own pleasure, you shouldn't be claiming mileage. You are abusing the system. We are all in this together.

If you claim mileage and **didn't actually drive to where you said you did**, you are no longer eligible for mileage claims. **You must have actually gone to where you said you went** - you can't just make up addresses for the sake of roughing out a claim. It's called "fraud", and your position at Treefrog should be reviewed for this.

*Please note that Treefrog requires 48 hours’ notice to have a rental car delivered. Failure to plan in advance does not constitue a reason to cause Treefrog additional expense.

### Phone Expenses 

> If you MUST have a phone for work, or you incur visible expenses you otherwise wouldn't due to Treefrog's involvement, we'll pay Treefrog's share.

Treefrog does not reimburse phone charges to Frogs that do not absolutely require a phone for their position. Examples that do;

- 24/7 Emergency Tech Support (read: Matt)

If a cell phone is required for your role, this will be discussed with you upon hire or upon change of your responsibility. We prefer you supply your own phone and number, but if you do not have one, Treefrog will provide one at which time it will be used exclusively for business purposes only and may be requested back at any time. If we buy you a phone, it belongs to Treefrog. Obviously.

Maximum reimbursement for cell phones is $60/month, if required for your role, which is enough to cover pretty much any need.

### Meals/Entertainment

> Treefrog does not reimburse meals.

It is up to you to bring their lunch or purchase their lunch.  If you chose, you may contribute to Pizza Fridays, and that amount will be deducted from your weekly pay.

Treefrog does not reimburse Frogs when taking out prospects for coffee, lunch or dinner.  If you feel you need to use this method to sell to a client, please speak to your Pod Leader regarding further training, as this is an anachronistic selling method, and considered fraud in many industries. There is coffee and beer at Treefrog - feel free to bring them here, or split the bill and only drink water. *A client who needs to be bought lunch isn't the right client for us.*

Treefrog does not cover overnight accommodations, unless approved and paid for by a client, or approved by a Pod Leader under specific circumstances (e.g. attending an event on another continent). If you can wake up early and drive there, you should.

Every once and a while, Treefrog will happily cover the costs of a Pod lunch or company meal event, as a gesture of thanks for a Pod's hard work. Each and every time, this should be cleared with the CEO. A reasonable budget should be established before the outing.

### Travel

> Travel at reasonable rates, only when necessary.

All travel requires CEO approval before any bookings are made.

Travelers must accept the lowest airfare and hotel rates. (Within reason, use your common sense and don't stay in a dangerous part of town or incur high Taxi costs to save on hotel rates).

### Office Supplies

> Office Supplies are not for use at your home.

Office supplies are kept in the downstairs area by the washrooms.  Frogs are welcome to use these supplies when needed for office use only. These supplies are not to be taken home, or used for personal use.  

If you have a request for an item that’s not in the supply area, you will need approval from your Pod Leader. Once you have approval, please send a request through to Client Care. We are happy to get you anything that will increase your efficiency or happiness (within reason).

### Communal Kitchen Supplies

> Treefrog is not a grocery store.

*If you would expect to see it in 99% of other professional offices, we'll provide it too.*

While Treefrog provides some snacks and additional items (like peanut butter, or crackers), our current business model does not contain the profit margin for feeding people. Please do not expect all of your food requests to be made at this time.

> We provide normal Ketchup.

Where we do provide additional alternatives, these would be provided for the majority, not the minority (for obvious cost management reasons). For example, we would provide communal Ketchup, but not Vegan Ketchup, Kosher Ketchup, Blue Ketchup, Hot Ketchup, etc. If you have specific physiological intolerances, religious requirements or other preferences that are not consistent with the majority of Frogs, please purchase these condiments on your own. This is not because we don't love you, but because managing Ketchup preferences is too complex and expensive for our small team.

### Mail Service

> Treefrog shouldn't be paying for you to send your personal mail.

Postage and mail delivery charges incurred while conducting company business are covered through Treefrog. If for a client, please ensure these are billed back to the project.

Treefrog is not obligated to accept COD deliveries for personal items. If you don't warn the front desk that it is incoming, we will turn it away. Maybe it's a scam?

### Corporate Card

> Treefrog is not a personal Interac Machine.

The corporate credit card must be used to purchase all business related expenses, where applicable.  The credit card is **not to be used to purchase personal items** and the company assumes no obligation to reimburse Frogs for expenses that are not in compliance with this policy.

It is also the responsibility of the cardholder to monitor usage of their account and report all fraudulent charges immediately to the corporate card provider.
