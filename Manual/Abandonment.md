# Job Abandonment

> If you don't show up and don't call, we don't know if you are alive or stranded on a desert island.


If you have been absent from work for three (3) or more consecutive days and you have not had a single communication to your Pod leader or anyone else, we will assume you have escaped to a desert island never to return.  In this case, you will have abandoned your job and tell us that you have voluntarily resigned.  

If there are extenuating circumstances related to your failure to report for work or contact your Pod leader, you are expected to contact them as soon as you are able.
