> We want people to be happy, healthy, and productive. We will do everything possible to ensure you safety while at work.

### Unsafe People List

As you know, I wish to keep you all forever. This includes ensuring you are fed, watered, and safe.

Part of this commitment is a commitment to your safety in general. Note that the policies below are for your safety and might seem "extreme". I do not care if they seem extreme. I wish to protect you all and make sure Treefrog is a safe and happy environment for all. We are not going to mess with any possibility of anything bad occuring but, instead, glorious innovation and creativity. We will have no tolerance for the presence of people at Treefrog who do not make us feel safe - kaput.

Our policy for unwelcome guests is as follows:

1) Should the individual approach Treefrog, and we catch this in advance:

- Lock the doors, go inside.
- Do not provoke, or play hero, in any way.
- Call the Police (subtly).
- If possible, subtly warn any relevant individuals to "go to the bathroom".

2) Should the individual in question enter Treefrog, we will:

- Indicate that the person he or she is looking for is not available ("with a client, doing business") and we will have the Frog he or she is wishing to contact know they this individual came to the office.
- Do not provoke or play hero in any way. Strike up a natural and meaningless conversation.
- Call the Police sublty if need be.
- If possible, subtly warn any relevant individuals to "go to the bathroom".

This is an intentional over-reaction to ensure everyone's safety. Taking it seriously ensures we are prepared and do not panic.

Treefrog is a place of safety for everyone. We are not going to try and negotiate, placate, or play hero and hope the individual goes away on his or her own accord. We have a wonderful, trained, and tactically prepared group of individuals to deal with unwelcome human guests known as, the police. Ironically, squirrels are more difficult and more expensive to get rid of. You do not need to think twice about it, just call the police. The police are super-nice people and will completely understand.

If anyone feels unsafe at any time for any reason at Treefrog or outside of Treefrog, please communicate to me and will make arrangements to ensure your safety. We will work together to create a safety plan for you and, if necessary, help you get help through agencies who are better equipped to help. We have each other's backs. This is the Frog way.

In addition, during a period where a specific individual feels unsafe, we will take additional measures to ensure his or her safety. 

**REMINDER**: Unless absolutely necessary, you should never be alone at Treefrog. If you are alone at Treefrog, especially at night, call another Frog to join you, and/or lock all of the doors and alarm the building with the "I am home" alarm button.
