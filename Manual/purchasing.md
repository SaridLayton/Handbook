# Purchasing

> Buy the best you can get within reason, and expect it to last longer.

There is a strategy to how we buy everything. Not everything will fit into these rules but this gives you a rationale as to **why** we buy like this.

We buy the best quality products in the marketplace, before the cost curve breaks up into "unnecessarily expensive", because:

- We expect the product to be more reliable than something cheaper
- We can expect it to last longer if it is better so we get a longer return on our investment
- There are less setup and admin costs when replacing it
- There are less training costs when replacing it
- If it lasts longer, we return less to the garbage can so we are more environmentally friendly 
- We get more joy during its use, possibly more functionality or additional competitive advantage
- We are the best so we want to be represented by the best
- We sustain a competitive advantage by staying out in front

### The "Buy Multiples" Rule

> Buy one as an experiment. If it is Epic, buy them for everyone.

We hate buying one of something. If you are only buying one of something, you need to ask yourself, "Is this really a Treefrog purchase?":

- We want things to match. It looks good and it is fair.
- If we buy something for one Frog, every one will want one. You are probably causing someone to think they are under-appreciated because of this.
- If we buy two and one stops working, we immediately know one is broken because it no longer acts like the other one.
- We can expect another will break in the same way, and anticipate it accordingly.

"While other airline fleets can employ 10 or more types of aircraft, Southwest uses just one, the Boeing 737. This results in all manner of cost-saving efficiencies: We only need to train our mechanics on one type of airplane. We only need extra parts inventory for that one type of airplane. If we have to swap a plane out at the last minute for maintenance, the fleet is totally interchangeableâ€”all our on-board crews and ground crews are already familiar with it. And there are no challenges in how and where we can park our planes on the ground, since they're all the same shape and size."

### The Importance of Brand

> Yes, we will pay extra for a Treefrog green one.

We not only have a commitment to quality, but also a commitment to our brand artifacts. This includes:

- **Color** - Everything you purchase should fit the Treefrog Branding Guidelines.
- **Quality** - Everything you buy should be the best quality possible, within budget and reason.
- **Modern, Clean** - Think about our decor. Think about what everything looks like around here. If your product stands out or is ugly or does not fit, Sean is going to kill you. Yes, this is relevant to everything in the server room, in your filing cabinet, in the bathroom cupboard, and everywhere else.

The way we buy one thing is the way we buy every thing.

### Who Buys It

If you are not absolutely sure you can buy it without asking someone about it, ask someone about it.

If it is under $500, a Pod Champion can buy it.
If it is over $500, you should probably contact the CEO.

Specific people have specific purchasing rights in order to maximize efficiency.

- **Quartermaster** - The quartermaster purchases everything for the internal operations of computers/phones/etc. Having one person manage this list saves us having two of anything we do not need.
- **Controller** - The controller buys everything related to office supplies, etc.

### Presenting Your Case

When presenting your case to purchase something, do not arrive with one product you want. Present the case for the product with comparable products. **Do your research**, because we want to make sure we get the perfect product with every purchase.

The more expensive the product, the more research you should do.

### How We Buy It

> If you can make it a monthly payment, make it a monthly payment.

Cash is King in our business, and we are always tight and trying to grow. Therefore, monthly subscriptions are far preferable to yearly payouts. Leases are preferred as one lump lease for similar products for a Pod, not many small leases.

##### Why Monthly Subscriptions

1. We do not pay 14% on the money (usually ends up costing more because we are usually short cash)
2. We do not get surprised in 3 years when we stop using it for something better
3. We can move with more agility when the compamy switches their service offerings

##### Why Lease

Leases, though expensive, keep cash in our bank account and allow us to grow. They help our credit rating, help add value to our bottom line, and keep the company moving.

1. **Always Lease to Buy for $1** - Then we can sell it or keep it longer than expected.
2. **Bundle Leases for Common Business Units** - Small leases get lost in adminstration, and we end up paying for them by mistake years later. Fewer leases mean less administrative mistakes. But leases with objects from various pods, desks, computers, software, make it difficult to track costs.
3. **Check all lease options before Leasing** - Leasing people have no soul. Make sure you check the numbers with multiple lease people before signing anything.
