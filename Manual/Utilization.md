> The Rule of Thumb

<i>The spirit of why this rule exists.</i>

 The explanation of the rule.
 
### Performance

There are always questions around “reasonable expectations” for a production person's performace - and how this leads to leakage.. So, I thought I’d put a few notes in here for discussion - feel free to share with your team members, so everyone is on the same page.

These concepts are critical for us as a company whose baseline of performance is Resources of Human Time - we don’t bill on how nice we are, we don't bill on great our ideas are (yet). Ironically, this is not connected to “skill level” - we make a (perhaps incorrect) assumption that all people are of equal skill - or more to the point - that a professional X is capable of doing Y in Z period of time. That’s a pretty reasonable assumption - as you get better and have been working a particular role for X years, you should be able to do it faster, and thus you should be a more senior individual and compensated accordingly for your accomplishments.

This is a starting theory on how we might differently (read: additionally) compensate people based on their performance. Or at least - better co-ordinate and thus rationalize “years of experience” versus “actual performance”.

### Performance Rules of Thumb

- If you aren’t on site 40 hours, you likely aren’t gonna hit billable hours.
- If you aren’t billing a minimum of 28 hours a week (on average), you aren't paying for yourself. 32 is a reasonable expectation.
- As your salary increases, your hours billed per week should increase as well.
- If you aren’t making $100/hour on average during these hours, you aren’t paying for yourself. If you go over the allocated hours on your projects due to mis-scoping, you won’t.
- If you are billing time into administration, or working on projects that don’t have a project listed in Frogweb, you aren’t adding billable time we can track. If it’s not in Frogweb, it doesn’t exist - so you are working on your own time. That’s stupid for everyone involved, don’t do it.

## Constraints

We have a number of constraints on our persons within our control, including (but not only);

1. The Number of Hours we do of billable work per week (**Utilization Rate**) - Time we are around, day to day, and working.
2. The ability to do the work in the Time Sold/Allocated (**Effective Hourly Rate**) - Our personal efficiency in getting things done.
3. The quality (**client success**) of the work (**Client Satisfaction Rate**) - A combination of our skill and focus.
4. How well you Get Along with Others (**Culture Fit**)  

*Our baseline expectation is that people work a minimum of 40 hours a week, as stated in our Employee Manual and expressed otherwise. This is higher than “most companies” - but we leave lots of room for other necessary obligations. In actual fact, we don’t care - we care about “contribution” (which is your billable hours multiplied by your effective hourly rate). But how can we help you improve if you aren’t here and kicking ass?

## Utilization

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization_rate 

It can be reasonably agreed upon that production team members will have ongoing expectations on them for “alternate administration things" - like email checking (15-30 mins a day), daily huddles (15 minutes a day), training (ad-hoc), Learn O’Clock and SoU (1-2 hours a week). These activities will take a minimum of 2-2.5 hours and thus reduce the effective utilization capacity rate of any given individual to 37.5 hours a week (unless you “work" up to the ESA acceptable standard of 44 hours a week).

In other words, although we "demand" 40 hours of work a week, we actually give back *at least* 2.5 hours in "fun time" or "learning time" which most other companies do not. So in effect, our "higher expectations" are only "higher expectations to be involved at Treefrog and learn".

*Some Pods are more efficient than others with their shared time. What are you doing to reduce the "extra time" you spend and increase your team utilization?*

If you look at your utilization time, you will find that you have a “quarterly trend” and a “yearly trend”. Quarterly trend is a reasonable assessment of your recent activity (weekly is pretty much useless - anyone can have a crap week, and anything can happen), though yearly trend will remove seasonality (such as Christmas holidays) from this assessment.

Back of the Envelope Perspective for a New Frog
The first X hours you work (example = 10 hours) pays for your salary, health and pension.
The second X hours you work (average = 12 hours) pays for the other person who supports you getting the work, managing the work, and fulfilling the work (Sales, Admin, etc.) - and protecting you from harm so you can work.
The third X hours you work (average = 5 hours) pays for your desk, electricity, computer, roof and air conditioning, etc.
*If you don’t bill at least 28 hours as a production Frog - you aren’t actually paying your way.

If you look at your fellow team members, you will find that they fluctuate between 28 and 37 hours on average. Interested in how you fair, and how you are being reviewed? Check the numbers below for the “average Frog” (these expectations vary upwards for more senior individuals)...

>37.5 hrs/week = Epic (Peak) Performance - “You deserve a bonus."
34 hrs/week = Excellent Performance - “Fantastic! Keep rocking!"
32 hrs/week = Good Performance - “You are doing a great job."
30 hrs/week = Acceptable Performance - “You are doing what is expected."
28 hrs/week = Mediocre Performance - “You are doing the minimum possible."
<28 hrs/week = Poor Performance - “You are dragging down the team."

It doesn’t always add up - you may be working hard, and be showing a low utilization rate. If you wonder why you are working a solid 40 hours a week, feel you are working hard, and you are suffering from being defined as having mediocre or poor performance by this theory - you are possibly billing time into administrative incorrectly or suffering from leakage. For example…

- You may be billing all of your client email time against Treefrog (which isn’t then billed to the client - meaning we are just throwing away billable time). So yes, mis-allocation reduces your utilization, and thus your effective performance. Work will your Pod Manager to find strategies to reduce this mis-allocation - there are lots of different strategies to alleviate this (e.g. different, more buckets, pre-allocation for core clients, etc.)
- You could be doing a ton of administrative meetings, which are actually either a) client-related or a) “internal”. Client related meetings should be billed to clients (In to “sales” if they aren’t yet a sale).. HAVE QUICKER INTERNAL MEETINGS, you’ll be more effective. EXCUSE YOURSELF from meetings you aren’t genuinely adding value at. There is time gold in those hills. :)
- You may be new at your job, so you may be spending an inordinate amount of time training and learning. (Under a year at Treefrog you should expect this). Get up to speed! Focus!
- You may have additional “social” activities which you bill to Admin… but it’s really just an excuse for social time. For example, Frog-a-versaries - some people bill 10 mins/wk for this, and others bill 1 hr/week. Who do you think is most effective? If you show up an hour early for a quick event and then hang out for an hour, is this an effective use of your time? No. Maybe you forgot to turn off your time clock? Then fix it - it will only screw you later.
- You may be just genuinely inefficient with your time, or take a lot more breaks or spend time navel-gazing. Work will your Pod members to find strategies to increase your efficiency as a group.

Also interesting, when you do some rough calculations on costing based on utilization at $100/hour (to be discussed later), you’ll see that at different salary grades, the expectation on your performance increases as your salary increases. Wondering why you aren’t considered a more “senior” grade? Check the table...

If you aren’t at least covering yourself, why would you qualify for a raise? 

Or to be considered for future bonuses or a “senior” title?

Effective Hourly Rate

Another constraint is your “effective hourly rate”. Sure - you might be working 37.5 hours a week - but if every project you work on you spend double your allocated time on (read: what it was sold for), you are also not being effective.

Let’s say, for example, a project sold for $1000, and you worked 10 hours on it. 1000/10 = $100/hour. Ergo, your effective hourly rate on that project is $100. If, however, you were able to do it in 5 hours, your effective hourly rate would have been $200. If you spend 20 hours on it (double!!), your effective hourly rate is $50.

- Our posted rates are $125-150.
- Our “minimum acceptable effective hourly rate” is $100.
- You won’t knock every project out of the park. But you should have a reasonable balance over the last X projects.

So, here’s another table of performance effect

>$125/hour = Epic (Peak) Performance - “You deserve a bonus.”*
$110/hour = Excellent Performance - “Fantastic! Keep rocking!"
$100/hour = Good Performance - “You are doing a great job."
$90/hour hrs/week = Acceptable Performance - “You are breaking even."
$75/hour = Mediocre Performance - “You are doing the minimum possible."
<$50/hour = Poor Performance - “You are dragging down the team.”

*Careful that external factors (like grant monies!) aren’t skewing your stats - you could be in for a hard days night later.

Bottom line is, you should be cognizant of what your responsibilities are before starting a project, and ensuring (before you start) that the project is doable within the allocated time. If not, you should go back to sales and re-negotiate*.

*The balancing factor here is that: sales needs to be able to sell it. If you want 1000 hours to pick your nose, clients won’t pay for it, and we’ll run out of work for you to do.
- You may believe sales “undersold” something on you. Or it was “mis-scoped”. So why didn’t your pod get together and work on a better rationale for the sales team that showed what value you were achieving for the client? Sales can’t stop - or you won’t have work to do. 
- If you focus on getting the work done, every time, under budget - you’ll almost always have an incredibly high effective hourly rate.

FAQ

Why are we always harping about 40 hours a week? Isn’t this overly bureaucratic?

If you aren’t working 40 hours a week, you can’t hit utilization - unless you skip all training, learning and social activities. The social activities are part of a functional team - so the hourly expectation is there to protect you. By keeping you honest to this, you keep the machine rolling and your performance high.

Why do we bother tracking Admin time? Why don’t we just bill Production Hours?

Because it’s possible that all the other things are actually a complete waste of time, and we can’t tell that that is the case until we’ve tracked them for a while and seen that they are. Maybe you actually are doing the work, and didn’t realize it - like not billing internal client meetings. The best way to rationalize this is track everything. Then we can get to the bottom of the problem, together.

If my Utilization rate is consistently above expected for my salary grade and my Effective Hourly Rate is higher than $100, what am I?

You are a high-performing, super competent Frog. Let’s talk about improving your compensation.

If it’s below?

Fix it. If your contribution is less than it should be, raises, bonuses and other perks aren’t ever on the table. If it’s too low, you are probably being significantly over-compensated for your role, and that deserves a discussion with your Pod Leader.
