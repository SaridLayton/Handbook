# Benefits

[TO BE UPDATED BY TINA OR JORDON]

The following is a brief description of Treegfrog’s benefit program. Upon eligibility you will receive a more detailed and comprehensive package. All full time Frogs are eligible to participate in the program following their 3 month observation period. Participation in the program is mandatory unless proper documentation is provided detailing involvement in a spouse’s benefit plan. Benefit programs are in place for:

1. Long Term Disability
2. Extended Health Care
3. Dental
4. Vision

All dental and health forms should be submitted to Great West Life directly by Frogs. Any changes to personal data including dependent information needs to be communicated promptly to the controller to avoid interruptions in benefit involvement.
