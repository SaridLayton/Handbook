> Keep your stuff at home and Treefrog's stuff at Treefrog.

<i>Best to not mix personal items with Treefrog items if at all possible. Best not to take home <b>anything</b> belonging to Treefrog for personal use without explicit permission.</i>*

*This doesn't apply to laptops, obviously.

Frogs are discouraged from bringing personal items to the workplace. If necessary, only the minimal amount of personal belongings should be kept at the workplace and it is the Frogâ€™s responsibility to keep them in a secure location. Treefrog will not accept responsibility for lost, stolen, or damaged articles. This includes the use of your own personal devices at work.

If you need something at work required to do your job: <b>Treefrog should be buying it for you</b>, you shouldn't have to buy it yourself. If there is something <i>absolutley required</i> to do your job, ask Treefrog to provide it.

This doesn't apply to specialty items, especially food.

If there is an item that you own that is at Treefrog under extenuating circumstances, <b>make sure it is marked clearly with your name on it</b>, like your mother used to do with your underwear. Then we know it is yours.

One place where this breaks down is in items you use for commuting, or dual-purposes (e.g. headphones). Best case scenario? Get two pairs - one for use at work provided by Treefrog because you need noise reduction while working - and when you get to work, lock up your personal pair while you are at work and then take them home when you leave.

### Rationale

There are a number of reasons why we as a team don't want your personal stuff at work.

1. Personal items aren't insured on premises unless explicitly listed in our insurance list and originally paid for by Treefrog. They could be stolen, or "borrowed", or damaged by others, and are considered to be outside of our bubble of liability. 
2. If you get suddenly sick or called away, and we have to move your stuff while you are gone - how do we know what is yours and what belongs to the company?

### Examples

1. We have had several examples of people "borrowing" items from each other's desks, only to go missing for weeks (e.g. charging cables).
1. We regularly have external events, kids, friends, etc. roaming around the place. We don't want to worry about your special Luck Troll.
1. A company we used to work with made their employees bring in their own toilet paper to keep costs down. This is a broken idea.
