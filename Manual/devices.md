# Devices

Treefrog will make a concerted effort to ensure you always have quality, working products and devices to do your job properly. It is your responsibility to treat all of Treefrog's devices with [respect](manual/respect) and care.

#### Replacing Devices

If your behaviour or lack of respect for a device leads to the destruction of a device, tool or piece of office equipment, you should replace the device at your own cost or you will be reviewed for termination. Some examples may include:

1. Using your device for non-Treefrog related activities (e.g. gaming, video rendering).
2. Sitting on your laptop in a car.
3. Using your device in the rain.
4. Knocking over a coffee onto your laptop at home.

However, should you have the dumb luck to destroy or damage a device unintentionally, Treefrog will replace it **once**. If you have a second mishap, a review of your respect of devices will be engaged.

#### Using Your Own Device

When using your own personal Smartphone, iPad or Laptop for Treefrog's purposes, it is important to note that Treefrog has the right to view data on the device and that anything saved on the device should not be viewed as private. If your personal device is lost, damaged, or stolen, Treefrog is not responsible to replace the device.

If you are using your own device for Treefrog activities, please let the [quartermaster-know](manual/quartermaster-know.md) immediately. In most cases, it is appropriate that you will be provided with a Treefrog device that is covered by warranty and insurance.

#### Laptop Security

For those Frogs that have portable computers we need to ensure you are operating with extreme measures to maintain safety and protection both at the office and off site locations. If one of our computers got into the wrong hands it could be severely detrimental to thousands clients. All machines will have a software called “Undercover” installed that will allow us to track our computer and its whereabouts very quickly so we can notify the police as soon as possible. This knowledge regarding this software and information is to be kept extremely confidential as a closely-held Frog secret.


### Software Lisencing

We do not use software at Treefrog, or put it on our laptops, unless it has been paid for. Not only is it unethical and counterintuitive to Treefrog's values, but also, if we are caught doing this, it could hurt our team through litigation or problems.

1. Don't install software you don't use
2. Don't install software without express consent from the [quartermaster](manual/quartermaster.md)
3. If you need something, ask for it. If it makes sense to buy it, we will.

Also remember, if you need something, although it looks simple to get, we do need to think about it. Therefore, expect it to take a reasonable amount of time to get the purchase completed for you.
