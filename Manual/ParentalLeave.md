### Parental Leave

> Take some time to enjoy your new baby.

Parental leave is another job protected leave under the ESA.  A Frog who is a parent and has been employed for at least 13 weeks is entitled to 35 weeks of unpaid parental leave following the birth of the child or 37 weeks for non-birth parents. A Frog who is entitled to parental leave must provide notice in writing at least two weeks before the leave is scheduled to commence. If he or she does not state when the leave will end, it will be assumed that he or she wishes to take the maximum leave.

We are cognizant that pregnancy and child-bearing is a beautiful, natural, and important process, and we want to work together with you to ensure the child is cared for appropriately. Different newborns and different parents have different needs. Let us work through this together.

> The kid makes the rules, not you. Keep us in the loop!

Also note that we are aware that, under most circumstances, the complexities of child birth and return-to-work dynamics are often filled with twists and turns - and the more Treefrog knows about your twists and turns, the more we can be adquately prepared for your return. Stay in touch!

### Parental Leave Options

Special projects may be able to be arranged for Frogs who are interested in working from home while caring for his or her new baby. This is highly contingent on your role, skills, and the work available at Treefrog.
