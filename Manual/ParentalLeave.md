### Parental Leave

Parental leave is another job protected leave under the ESA.  A Frog who is a parent and has been employed for at least 13 weeks is entitled to 35 weeks of unpaid parental leave following the birth of the child or 37 weeks for non-birth parents. A Frog who is entitled to parental leave must provide notice in writing at least two weeks before the leave is scheduled to commence. If he or she does not state when the leave will end, it will be assumed that he or she wishes to take the maximum leave.

### Parental Leave Options

Special projects may be able to be arranged for Frogs who are interested in working from home while caring for his or her new baby. This is highly contingent on your role, skills, and the work available at Treefrog.
