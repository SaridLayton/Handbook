# Hours

The standard work week consists of 40 paid hours, Monday to Friday, 9:00 am to 5:30 pm each day. Any exceptions to the standard work day hours must be represented and approved by his or her Pod Leader prior to the event.

### Flexible Hours

Treefrog offers an alternative of flexible working hours for roles at Treefrog that qualify as [information-technology-professionals](manual/information-technology-professionals.md) or [managers](manual/managers.md). For those individuals who wish to have flexible hours, a request for these hours must be approved by the Pod Leader who will reasonably and appropriately allow for these flexible hours.

> Flexible Hours does not mean, "I work whenever I want". Flexible Hours means, "I have the flexibility to be accomodated for my lifestyle by setting specific hours for when I work, and my Flexible Hours do not hurt the team".

Core hours of 11:00 am to 3:00 pm are required as part of a flexible working hours request. Please note that although every effort will be made to accommodate the request for flexible hours and granted flexible hour schedules, client and/or internal meetings will supersede these scheduling exceptions. 

For customer service and security reasons, the office policy requires that 2 people be in the office at all times during core hours. Additionally, there must be one person from each client-facing Pod. Please schedule your hours, meals, and breaks accordingly.

### Attendance

Much of our work is interdependent on others so being ready for work at your desk at your appointed time is expected. Punctuality reflects a positive interest and attitude toward your job. Habitually arriving late for work is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action.


### Guidelines

If you are going to be late for work, you must notify your manager as soon as possible or by no later than 9:00 a.m. if your flexible time starts earlier.
Absence due to tardiness must be made up outside of working hours. These hours must be approved by management beforehand so as not to compromise workflow.
You must notify your manager about time required for personal appointments (e.g. doctor, dentist) at least 48 hours prior to the time that will be missed. Such appointments should be made at the beginning or end of the day, whenever possible, to minimize the impact on Treefrog’s workflow. Excused time for personal appointments must be made up, and these hours must be approved by management beforehand so as not to compromise workflow.

### Exempt and Non-Exempt

Exempt Frogs hold positions that are managerial in nature. These Frogs are exempt from the hours of work and overtime provisions. Information Technology is an industry that falls under a “special rule”, and Frogs working in this sector are also exempt from the above provisions. Non- exempt Frogs are those Frogs holding positions that are not managerial in nature. Non-exempt Frogs are subject to the hours of work, rest periods, and overtime provisions.

### Minimum/Maximum Weekly Hours

Our company has a higher than average minimum expectation of 40 hours of work a week. Most companies expect you to be on site for 40 hours a week (the old 9-5 rule), and then give you paid time for lunch and breaks.

Treefog does not pay for breaks or lunch. You are "legally obligated" to take a lunch break for a minimum of 30 minutes and two breaks of 15 minutes. Therefore, you are theoretically obligated to stay onsite at least 9 hours a working day. However, since we usually talk about work during lunch and/or eating at our desks and since there are no physically demanding roles that require physical rest, the suggestion is that if you wish, you may multitask your lunch break to continue specific work-related discussions and thus combine lunch and work. Talking about people who work here is not a work-related discussion. Talking about a project is a work related-discussion.

On the other end, as a salaried employee, you cannot work more than a maximum of 48 hours a week. We do not pay overtime for work over 48 hours. You are all salaried, and thus the expectation is that everyone works between 40-44, maximum 48, hours a week in return for the value of their salary. Also, you must take 11 hours off consecutively each day, you must take 8 hours of rest in between "shifts", and you must take 24 hours a week to rest.

The exception to this rule is if there are "extraordinary circumstances" -  for example, an "emergency". An "emergency" qualifies as something unforeseen that interrupts one of the processes of Treefrog's business:

- Equipment or Software failures that affect the business
- Computer failure - hardware or software
- The phone system fails
- A server goes down
- A website stops functioning
- Weather-related issues; for example, snow storm - We do not pay for you to sit around during a snow storm.

In these cases, if an emergency happens, you can work up to a maximum of 60 hours a week. In other words, if the file system stops working, as a salaried employee, you are not theoretically paid for the time you cannot do your work. This time is the result of an unforseen emergency, and you will need to make sure you complete your 40 hours of work. There is no "overtime pay". We are all in this together. We are all managing our own time, we are all managing our own fates, and we all have to put in extra if there is a failure in the system that we have created and that we support.

Also note, you cannot work more than 60 hours a week. If you do this, you will eventually kill yourself and that is not good for anyone. This has only happened a few times with people in non-emergency scenarios, and it has prompted a discussion in every case.

Also, if you end up intentionally working until 4 in the morning, you should not really come in for 8 hours. This means, noon the next day. If it is an emergency, this may not qualify, but it is fair logic. To clarify, intentionally is being defined as the result of planned and required late-night work, not because you want to complete something and cannot sleep until you do. 

Please adjust your thinking if you are not already thinking this way. Everyone on the team is a salaried employee, and everyone is responsible for doing their part to keep the boat floating.

### Home Hours

Bottom line, working from home is a mixed bag of value. Although you may be more efficient in accomplishing specific tasks at home, the overall effect on communication, access to correct resources, confusion by others, need of other's to take on additional responsibilities when you are not available, and so on, can impact overall team productivity and Treefrog's potential combined success. We are much more efficient if we are all working together in the same space. 

### Time VS Energy

The whole discussion above is pretty stupid and for most people, at most times, is somewhat redundant. At the end of the day, all of this is: "I have a job" rhetoric, not, "glorious success and happiness for all involved on the team" rhetoric. The fact is we all go through periods of energy and burnout. We all have weeks we need to take it easy and weeks we are passionately engaged to achieve more.

This is merely a framework for everyone to understand the basic minimum expectations so that you know when you are "onside" or "offside", and the amount of work you need to put in for the group to be successful. We also "pay" for learning time, fun time, and growing time. This is not intended to be Draconian, but rather, to make sure we are all pulling forward and not just dropping our paddles in the water and riding on the efforts of others. The expectation is that everyone works harder than the average person elsewhere. We are Frogs.

Do not do less than 40 hours of work. If you are over 44 hours, you probably need to have your role reevaluated. If emergencies are keeping us awake every night and we are working 60 hours, we should rethink the whole shebang and go into landscaping or sulphur mining instead of web development, programming, and hosting.

### Discretionary Effort and the Individual Effect

Now, let us do some quick math:

When 25 Frogs work 1 extra minute a day, let us say content inputting because everyone can do that, this is the equivalent of 25 minutes a day or 2.5 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production minute, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months /60mins);

1 Minute a Day = $1128/month = $13,541/year

ONE minute of extra paid work by 25 Frogs pays for a 100MB fiber connection.

When 25 Frogs work 1 extra hour a day, let us again say content inputting because everyone can do that, this is the equivalent of 25 hours a day or 125 hours a week. Adjusted for seasonality, the "opportunity value" of that production hour, inclusive of all in the team, is (1min x 25peeps x $125/hour x 5days x 52weeks /12 months);

1 Hour a Day = $67,708/month in Productivity = $812,500/year (half our current revenue)

Another way to look at this is if we lose 1 hour of work due to an Internet failure, or we work 39 hours a week instead of 40, or an emergency server issue costs us an evening of grief, we are cutting off our opportunity to grow and succeed. Working less than 40 hours is stealing from our potential success.

That little extra bit of time and/or effort is the difference of getting us to the next level, getting us into position to give out raises, or putting us in a position to hire more help to take stress away from you.

Here are some interesting facts and effects that have never been mentioned, but as a matter of transparency, are now being shared. (These are not rules, but rules of thumb):

- If FrogWeb shows you consistently breaking above 44-48 hours, you get the first conversation about your role and how to change/modify your role or efficiency to keep you from breaking down. This begs the question that if you are being payed appropriately at your current value, why this is happening, and what do we do to fix it.
- If FrogWeb shows you below 40 hours of work in a trailing quarter, there are red flags. You will not even be considered for a raise for the hour of time required to dig into your time expenditure and overall contribution to the team. Other people get the conversation first. I consider your fewer hours of negative value as equivalent to an unrealized cash bonus you have self-assigned.
- Depending on your role, if FrogWeb shows more than 2-3 hours a week of "Admin" time over and above your 40 hours, and your role does not necessitate this by definition, there are red flags. You are possibly putting time in for work that you should not; such as, "computer failure", "lunch", "an error on a specific site [you] should have fixed", or "cleaning up after a client when [you] should have billed it under a project". Questions are raised about how you are using FrogWeb and what you are hiding. You can and should track this type of activity under Admin, and your activity should balance out to some degree with work and/or 40+ hours. If your computer is not working properly, you should be trying to do other work that is effective rather than sitting around twiddling your thumbs burning admin time. 
- We support the flexibility of going and getting your license renewed or your teeth cleaned during the day so that you do not have to on your weekend - that is stupid. If you do not catch up on the time in a meaningful way, however, you are hurting the person sitting next to you by not carrying your weight.

Again, this is not a call to work hours of free overtime. It would be preferable for you to work exactly 40 hours every week and maintain a critical and meaningful focus, accomplishing error-free and client-loving work, and keep your energy intact. However, please do not watch the clock - watch the team and our future. Be wary that excessive admin time, an emergency scenario, server failure, computer failure, or abuse of the unique flexibility we offer can threaten our very existence by taking away from our forward momentum. We have to rise above these issues if we are to succeed.

One last point, if we spent an extra 10 minutes every day, right at the moment we were going to leave, working on Treefrog itself, website/social/etc., we would be adding thousands of dollars in marketing value to our company as a whole.
