# Hours

The standard work week consists of 40 paid hours, Monday to Friday, 9:00 am to 5:30 pm each day. Any exceptions to the standard work day hours must be represented and approved by your Pod Leader.

### Flexible Hours

Treefrog offers an alternative of flexible working hours for roles at Treefrog that qualify as [information-technology-professionals](manual/information-technology-professionals.md) or [managers](manual/managers.md). For those individuals who wish to have flexible hours, a request for these hours must be approved by the Pod Leader who will reasonably and appropriately allow for these flexible hours.

> Flexible Hours does not mean, "I work whenever I want". Flexible Hours means, "I have the flexibility to be accomodated for my lifestyle by setting specific hours for when I work, and only where my chosen and approved Flexible Hours do not hurt or limit the effectiveness of the team".

Core hours of 11:00 am to 3:00 pm are required as part of a flexible working hours request. Please note that although every effort will be made to accommodate the request for flexible hours and granted flexible hour schedules, client and/or internal meetings will supersede these scheduling exceptions. 

For customer service and security reasons, the office policy requires that 2 people be in the office at all times during core hours. Additionally, there must be one person from each client-facing Pod. Please schedule your hours, meals, and breaks accordingly.

### Punctuality/Tardiness

See [Punctuality/Tardiness](Manual/Punctuality.md).

### Absenteism

See [Absenteeism](Manual/Absenteism.md).

### Hours of work

Normal maximum daily and weekly limits on hours of work are:

- 8 hours a day (or the number of hours in your regular work day, if it is more than 8),
- 48 hours a week. (Unless you are "Exempt", then it is 60)

As part of your contract, however, under "flexible hours", you also agreed to the following;

- to work more than 8 hours a day (or the number of hours in your regular work day, if it is more than 8), when appropriate.
- to work more than 48 hours a week during weeks of unusually high demand,
- to average the hours you work over multiple weeks to calculate overtime pay.

### Minimum/Maximum Weekly Hours

Our company has a higher than average minimum expectation of **40 hours of work** a week. Most companies expect you to be on site for 40 hours a week (the old 9-5 rule), and then give you paid time for lunch and breaks (i.e. 37.5 hours).

Treefog **does not pay for breaks or lunch**. You are "legally obligated" to take a lunch break for a minimum of 30 minutes. Therefore, at Treefrog, you are theoretically obligated to stay onsite at least 8.5 hours a working day. 

You may, however, have a **working lunch**. Since we usually talk about work during lunch and/or eating at our desks and since there are no physically demanding roles that require physical rest, the suggestion is that if you wish, you may multitask your lunch break to continue specific work-related discussions and thus combine lunch and work. <i>Talking about people who work here is not a work-related discussion. Talking about a project is a work related-discussion.</i>


### Overtime

See [Overtime](Manual/Overtime).

### Home Hours

Bottom line, working from home is a mixed bag of value. Although you may be more efficient in accomplishing specific tasks at home, the overall effect on communication, access to correct resources, confusion by others, need of other's to take on additional responsibilities when you are not available, and so on, can impact overall team productivity and Treefrog's potential combined success. We are much more efficient if we are all working together in the same space. 

### Exceptional Circumstances

The exception to the rule is if there are "extraordinary circumstances" -  for example, an "emergency". An "emergency" qualifies as something unforeseen that interrupts one of the processes of Treefrog's business:

- Equipment or Software failures that affect the business
- Computer failure - hardware or software
- The phone system fails
- A server goes down
- A website stops functioning
- Weather-related issues; for example, snow storm - We do not pay for you to sit around during a snow storm.

In these cases, if an emergency happens, you can work up to a maximum of **60 hours a week**. In other words, if the file system stops working, as a salaried employee, you are not theoretically paid for the time you cannot do your work. This time is the result of an unforseen emergency, and you will need to make sure you complete your 40 hours of work. There is no "overtime pay". We are all in this together. We are all managing our own time, we are all managing our own fates, and we all have to put in extra if there is a failure in the system that we have created and that we support.

Also note, you cannot work more than 60 hours a week. If you do this, you will eventually kill yourself and that is not good for anyone. This has only happened a few times with people in non-emergency scenarios, and it has prompted a discussion in every case.

Also, if you end up intentionally working until 4 in the morning, you should not really come in for 8 hours. This means, noon the next day. If it is an emergency, this may not qualify, but it is fair logic. To clarify, intentionally is being defined as the result of planned and required late-night work, not because you want to complete something and cannot sleep until you do. 

Please adjust your thinking if you are not already thinking this way. Everyone on the team is a salaried employee, and everyone is responsible for doing their part to keep the boat floating.
