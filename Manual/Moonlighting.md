Moonlighting

[ONLY READ IF YOU THINK THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU - then send me an email to chat]

It would appear that there is some confusion around Treefrog’s policies on moonlighting, and thus I am adding clarity here for future reference. “Moonlighting” refers to doing work (paid or not), for a client or for yourself, "after hours".

Types of Moonlighting

If you are doing work after hours that is unrelated to your work at Treefrog - then you are moonlighting. This work can fall into a few different areas;

1) Energy Drain Work - You are doing work completely unrelated to Treefrog. (Like being a waitress, or an actor).
2) Hobby Work - You have a hobby on the side you are genuinely passionate about which generates revenues (like selling soap).
3) Marginal Conflict of Interest Work - You are doing work which Treefrog would usually do, but you have rationalized doing it for a “family member”, or a “not for profit”, or because “the client couldn’t afford Treefrog’s pricing”, or you feel obligated doing it for the individual because of your relationship with them. You could be doing it for free, or for pay, or for free for someone else who is getting paid (like a family member).
4) Conflict of Interest - You are doing work for someone whose work "could have been done by Treefrog", for pay.
4) Direct Conflict of Interest - You are doing work for one of our clients on the side.
5) Community Support - You are working for a not for profit on the side to help the community to do work which not in conflict of interest with Treefrog’s products or services (like handing out hotdogs).
6) Religious Activity Work - Not relevant.

Note that our contracts and our Employee Manual are both very clear on the matter: you have agreed to “exclusive service” with Treefrog and that any work you do on the side is grounds to lose your job without warning. We are not an hourly-pay company. We pay you a salary for your time and energy, and the expectation is that all of your energy are belong to us.

Note also that we have made offers to potential superstar employees who would not sign this agreement in the past, and not hired them. This is core to the spirit of Treefrog employment. Treefrog has your back, and you have Treefrog’s back - Frog for Life.

The Rationale

At the root of our policy, our intent is not to be draconian, and make your life miserable or prevent you from being successful. There are some simple issues which need to be addressed;

- Total Net Energy - If you are working at all for another organization or for another job after hours or on weekends, you are not re-charging effectively in your time off. This will lead you to have less energy, be more difficult and grumpy with other Frogs, lose variables and information relevant to your salaried role when the other job creates stress and exhaustion. You are less valuable to Treefrog, and we should not have to pay your full salaried price for a fraction of your energy and ongoing reduced mental capacity. You are undermining your future here.

- Competing for Time - Our philosophy enables you to take time off during Treefrog hours to make your life less stressful. If you have another job, it is Treefrog and your peers that suffers when you need to use Treefrog time to buy groceries or get sick from exhaustion (directly relating to the other position or not). At the core of our magnificent flexibility is the assumption that we aren't flexing around another company's work schedule, but around your "life". (Where "life" = recharging and having fun).

- You are Treefrog’s Competitor - If you are doing work which Treefrog would do, irrelevant of trappings of price, etc., you are a competitor. This is (under Canadian Law) akin to theft.

- You are Leveraging Treefrog’s Investments for your Own Gain - Let’s hope you aren’t using Treefrog’s assets for your own purposes (like software or a computer, or a document we paid to put together) - as that would be blatantly illegal. However, the education, knowledge, processes, etc. that you have developed at Treefrog belongs to us as a team. Using them externally undermines Treefrog's value in the marketplace. Why would anyone pay for a logo if you can lean on a designer to get one for free?

- You are Damaging the Marketplace - You wonder why people don’t want to pay $150/hour for your work, and want a raise, yet you are creating a competitive environment where people believe they should be able to get these services less expensively.

- You are Creating Competitors for OUR Clients - So you build a website than has nothing to do with our clients - and suddenly, we get a client in the same space. You know we either have to fire you or they have the right to sue us, right? Or your side-client ends up competing with us without even knowing it?

 - It Usually Goes Sideways - We have created a very complex mechanism to bill, protect, clarify and deliver our products and services. When you do work on your own, you could get sued, have to stay up ridiculously late, have to take time off, have to cancel your plans, have to have multiple accounts, etc. Your projects can and will go sideways, which will add stress and complexity and reduce your value to Treefrog and your team.

- You Have Created a Potential Legal Issue - You represent Treefrog, even when not at work. If you are working off-hours, the client with whom you have agreed to do the work could lay claim that your equipment/knowledge/whatever was connected to Treefrog - and we have now been dragged into your fight without proper protections for which we pay so dearly.

- You Lessen Your Passion - If you make a thousand widgets during the day (and love doing it) - and then go home and make widgets on the side for fun or for profit - eventually, your passion for making widgets will burn out. You make think it won’t, but your brain needs balance to be fully self-actualized. You need a break from work.

- You are Setting a Cultural Precedent - Sure, doing that one thing isn’t a big deal. Suddenly, someone is a full-time nurse on the side, taking days off to get shifts, and thinks it is OK cause “Treefrog has flexible hours". Gimme a break.

It is pretty much impossible to work a second job and not compromise your work at Treefrog. Ultimately, you working at all on the side costs us all. You are making a decision which affects Treefrog and your team members, drastically.

Why Would Anyone Engage in Conflict of Interest Work?

You are Broke and Need More Money - If this is the case, and you are working your full expectation of work hours - Treefrog would be happy to engage you in a side contract to do something else. (A “ninja project”, as it were). Although this is pushing the boundaries of the ESA, I’d rather you got exhausted adding value to Treefrog - even if it outside your current skill set - than trigger all of the points above. Imagine getting paid to improve LEAP, or paint some walls? Imagine improving your own day-job life with your night-time life? Alternatively - you have the wrong career-choice VS lifestyle mix. Let's talk about it.

You Want to Help a Not-For-Profit - Great. So would Treefrog, it's part of our bottom line as a company. Bring ye the project forth, and let's consider doing the project together, where the whole team has your back.

You are Getting Peer Pressured from Family, Church or Friends - Often we get attacked to do something on the side, because "our mom can't afford it". After reading all of the points above, if you still believe you must do work for said individual (and can't use the excuse "but I could get fire over it"), then it must be really, really important to you. Let's talk about it.

My Mom Has a Web Company - Your Mom just started a web company, and you think you should help her (it keeps money in the family). I'm pretty sure every court in the world would arrive at the same conclusion - you should go work for her full time.

You are Bored - I can cure this pretty quickly. Please come see me immediately.

Self-Improvement - OK, this is a good rationale. You want to learn to do something, and are willing to work on the side to improve your skills/chops so as to improve your value to Treefrog. But if this is your 5th Wordpress site that you are getting paid to do, I don't think you have much to stand on. However, I agree, there's no reason to not get paid to do something ONCE. Disclose it. Let's talk about the effect on the team as a whole.

If you are doing random work (like mowing lawns on the side), I'm sure we can agree that it won't hurt Treefrog. But if it is a Conflict of Interest, you have crossed the line.

The Bottom Line

The key question which puts your work in critical danger is: Are you in direct conflict with Treefrog with your work? The Acid Test to determining whether you are in conflict with the work you are performing is in direct conflict or not is easy: ask yourself the question: "Would Treefrog sell this?”? Irrelevant of the trappings of price, quality, goals, etc. If you are confused or it is a grey area - you need to ask a senior individual at Treefrog if it crosses the line or not.

Energy Drain Work Conflicts - If you are working a second job (“Energy Drain Work”), you are less valuable to Treefrog that what we are paying you for. You need to disclose this fact and it needs to be considered the next time you are eligible for a raise, re-thinking your role, etc. We reserve the right to not pay you the percentage of time under 40 hours a week that you have not worked, and re-set your salary at this lower level moving forward if you wish to keep your job. We also reserve the right to give you more free time to pursue this work. All of it, in fact.

Hobby Work Conflicts - If you have a hobby on the side, you need to disclose it to Treefrog and explain how it will not affect your current job. You can’t claim Conflict of Interest work as a hobby, that’s just regular work. (See Damaging the Marketplace*)

Community Support Work (Conflict of Interest) - Simply put - one of the bottom lines of Treefrog’s existence is helping the community. If your church needs a website, and wants you to do it for them - approach Treefrog about it. Perhaps we can do it inexpensively, you could do it on the side for pay (with limited team support), and Treefrog can broadcast our involvement (thus bringing the additional value to Treefrog). There is always a way.

Community Support Work (Not Conflict of Interest) - So you want to volunteer at a local theatre or local Soup Kitchen? Fantastic! This is great. Yes, it will affect Treefrog through your lowered net energy, but it will help balance your brain, bring you satisfaction as an individual, help the world and make our lives meaningful. If the possibility exists that it might affect your work, (say through a day off or reduced energy) then disclose it, and allow Treefrog to own it with you. In other words, we’ll support you in it, and broadcast your involvement (thus bringing additional value to Treefrog in return).

Direct Conflict of Interest Work - It is the end of your engagement at Treefrog. We are obligated to take legal action against you to prevent liability for ourselves in future.

Marginal Conflict of Interest Work - You believe that your potential client (or client) “can’t afford Treefrog’s pricing”. This could be because they are just getting started, or any of the reasons above. You are obligated to disclose, and discuss. We'll look at the points above and discuss a go-forward plan.

Your Own Project on the Side - This needs to be covered under a different discussion - namely, Intellectual Property. Bottom line: disclose, disclose, disclose. Then you will get a better understanding if it is appropriate to work or not.

You are required to disclose to Treefrog what work you are doing. 

How To Handle Getting Asked for Direct Competitive Work

Many people at Treefrog have been asked by clients to do work under the table for them. A few have tried (and are no longer with us). If a client asks you to do this, immediately disclose this to me, and refuse the work. Should you take the work, you are relinquishing your right to Treefrog employment.

How to Handle Work That Treefrog Would DO

Approach Sean, and disclose all of the facets of the potential work. Consider if this helps your career, or if it limits your career. Consider if it helps your team, or compromises your team.

Make sure there is a paper trail.

How to Handle it if you are Working Now, Cause You Forgot This Section Of Our Employee Handbook

Disclose it immediately. Let’s discuss it.

If you disclose it immediately, we can discuss options for moving forward. If you don’t disclose it, each and every time, it is grounds for termination.


I hope this is clear for everyone. It certainly seems clear to me, and the rationale around it. However, I don't want to start a big public conversation about it with the Frogs which leads to leakage - so please approach me privately, and if you are able to add thoughts or rationale or points (negative or positive) to the mix, please let me know.

As you know, my focus is not on making lives miserable, but making Treefrog better. Making us better.
