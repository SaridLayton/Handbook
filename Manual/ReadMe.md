# Manual

Treefrog's goal is to foster a fun, productive, and enthusiastic environment that employees look forward to being a part of each day. We would like the workplace to be full of inspiration, creativity, and innovation.

In addition, Treefrog's intent is to excel and provide an environment in which to excel. Treefrog would like Frogs to have the most respected and coveted jobs in all industries and maintain high personal and corporate reputations in a stimulating, supportive workplace. In return, Treefrog expects individuals to be highly, personally motivated, to work harder and longer, to have extraordinary intent to achieve and intent to comprehend, to be more self-aware, more self-managing, and more personally accountable than people in any other circumstance at any other job. It is a big ask.

The success of any organization is based on the individual success of each person in that organization.Â Our combined attitude is only as good as the least favourable attitude in the company. We ask that all Frogs continually remind themselves of this and hold each other accountable for his or her attitude and overall perception. This includes all Frogs' attitudes about the workplace, our clients, and fellow Frogs either at home, at work, and especially, in public.

Treefrog will continue to achieve and would like all Frogs to achieve with us as a team. We all need to be deeply respectful of one another and understand what that means.

This Manual is not designed to address every circumstance or question that may arise over the course of your employment with Treefrog, and it is not intended to stifle creativity in how you do your work. The guidelines are intended to help you with your work life and ensure that your expectations are clear.

The purpose of this Manual is to:

- Summarize the policies and practices of the company in an open, dynamic format.
- Set the company standard for professional conduct and responsibilities for every Frog.
- Add clarifying examples and explanations where possible.
- Allow for open and transparent dialogue surrounding conduct and responsibility.
- Keep a living history of questions around policies and legalities to maximize growth in the future.
- Allow for fast additions when new issues or concerns arise.

The policies and procedures in this Manual will be added and expanded upon as the company and Frogs continue to grow and mature.

It is not enough to be a good place to work. Treefrog wants to set an example for all other businesses on how the perfect business should be run and how all people, in every job, should act.
