# The Manual

Treefrog's goal is to foster a fun, productive, and enthusiastic environment that employees look forward to being a part of each day. We would like the workplace to be full of inspiration, creativity, and innovation.

In addition, Treefrog's intent is to excel and provide an environment in which to excel. Treefrog would like Frogs to have the most respected and coveted jobs in all industries and maintain high personal and corporate reputations in a stimulating, supportive workplace. In return, Treefrog expects individuals to be highly, personally motivated, to work harder and longer, to have extraordinary intent to achieve and intent to comprehend, to be more self-aware, more self-managing, and more personally accountable than people in any other circumstance at any other job. It is a big ask.

What follows is a collaborative description of how we are going accomplish this Heraclean task.

It is not enough to be a good place to work. Treefrog wants to set an example for all other businesses on how the perfect business should be run and how all people, in every job, should act.
