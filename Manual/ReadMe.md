# Manual

Treefrog Inc.'s goal is to foster a fun, productive, and enthusiastic environment that employees look forward to being a part of each day. We would like the workplace to be full of inspiration, creativity and innovation.

In addition, our intent is to excel and provide an environment in which to excel. We would like Frogs to have the most respected and coveted jobs in all industries and maintain high personal and corporate reputations in a stimulating, supportive workplace. In return, we expect individuals to be highly, personally motivated, work harder and longer, have extraordinary intent to achieve and intent to comprehend, be more self-aware, more self-managing, and more personally accountable than people in any other circumstances, at any other job. It is a big ask.

The success of any organization is based on the individual success of each person in that organization.Â  Our combined attitude is only as good as the least favourable attitude in the company. We ask that all Frogs continually remind themselves of this and hold each other accountable for their attitude and overall perception. This includes attitude about workplace, clients, and fellow Frogs, while at home, while at work, and especially in public.

Treefrog will continue to achieve and would like you to achieve with us as a team. We all need to be deeply respectful of one another and understand what that means.
