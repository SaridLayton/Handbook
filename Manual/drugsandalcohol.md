# Alcohol

> Feel free to drink. Do not drink and work. Do not drink and drive.

Treefrog is concerned with the safety of its Frogs under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the job because being under the influence poses serious safety and health risks to themselves and others. In addition to affecting job performance, it could also affect Treefrog's excellent and professional reputation. Therefore, it is Treefrogâ€™s policy that the use, sale, possession, and/or being under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol during working hours is strictly prohibited. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

### Drinking and Driving

Under no circumstances! Seriously people, do not do it.

If you have a beer while at Treefrog and you intend to drive home, we will arrange for you to be taken home by another sober Frog or an Uber. Walk, bus, train, or otherwise crawl your way home, but never drive. If you are not sure, do not question it. We will find you a way home.

You may, if absolutely necessary, to prevent you from driving, sleep off your hangover in the sleep room at Treefrog. However, you may not, under any cirsumstances, bring non-Frogs into the office during this period.

### Drugs

Seriously people? There are never, ever, to ever be illegal substances on the premises. You are never to be working while under the influence of drugs. You are never to sell or distrubute drugs.

This could end Treefrog - not just our reputation, but our business. We have zero tolerance of this.

The fact that a section on this needs to be included makes me crazy.

### After Hours Events - Alcohol

We do, sometimes, serve alcohol to people who do not work here.

Make sure they are always served by someone with a Smart Serve certification, and do not let them drive home.

### SmartServe Certification

Ideally, everyone should get trained in SmartServe.
