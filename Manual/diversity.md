# Diversity

> Everyone has an equal right to being a Frog.

We celebrate diversity and embrace the creativity that comes from being open to a broad range of cultures, ideas, and opinions.

### Equal Opportunity

Treefrog maintains a policy of non-discrimination for all Frogs and job applicants. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, and all terms of employment. We will not discriminate on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed (religion), gender, sexual orientation, age, record of offences, marital status, family status (being in a parent-child relationship), disability, or any other grounds prohibited by the Ontario Human Rights Code. All aspects of employment will be governed on the basis of individual experience, skills, ability, attitude, and potential, without bias or prejudice.

### Gender Discrimination vs. Recognition

Although we do not discriminate on gender, we do expect (for reasons of cultural appropriateness and according to [sexual harassment](sexual harassment)) that different genders have different needs. For example, in bathroom usage, matching plumbing to plumbing is not discrimination - it is plumbing.

### Washrooms and Gender

If you are in a public bathroom and you think a stranger's gender does not match the sign on the door, follow these steps:

1. Do not worry about it - he or she knows better than you.
