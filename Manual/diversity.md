# Diversity

> Everyone has an equal right to being a Frog.

We celebrate diversity and embrace the creativity that comes from being open to a broad range of cultures, ideas, and opinions.

### Equal Opportunity

Treefrog maintains a policy of non-discrimination for all Frogs and job applicants. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits and all terms of employment. We will not discriminate on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed (religion), gender, sexual orientation, age, record of offences, marital status, family status (being in a parent-child relationship), disability or any other grounds prohibited by the Ontario Human Rights Code. All aspects of employment will be governed on the basis of individual experience, skills, ability, attitude, and potential, without bias or prejudice.

### Gender Discrimination vs. Recognition

Although we do not discriminate on gender, we do expect (for reasons of cultural appropriateness and according to [sexual harassment](sexual harassment)) that different genders have different needs. For example, in bathroom usage. Matching plumbing to plumbing is not discrimination, it's plumbing.

### Recognizing Gender

If you have difficulty recognizing the gender of your fellow Frog, please try the following:

1. **Do some measuring.** Males are noticeably smaller than females in most species of frog. A typical male frog is one and one half to two and one quarter inches long from head to bottom. Females are two to three inches long.
2. **Be a good listener.** Males croak at night. This sounds like a duck quacking and sometimes a dog barking. Males will croak to the sound of vacuums, running water, loud noises, to attract females, and sometimes for no reason at all. Females, on the other hand, don't really make any noises. Understand that if you still can't figure it out, you can ask an experienced breeder or a veterinarian.
3. **Look at the throat.** Most male frogs have a dark patch on their throat because as they croak, it creates friction on the throat and darkens their throat.
4. **Check the ear.** The ear of the frog is near the brain. If it is big, it's a male but if it is small, then it's a female.

Hold off on naming a frog until you know what sex it is, unless you are willing to change the name later. Or you could name it something that would work for a male or a female, like Jumpy, for example.

If you are confused by this section, you should not be making decisions, comments or complaints based on gender.

### Washrooms and Gender

If you're in a public bathroom and you think a stranger's gender does not match the sign on the door, follow these steps:

1. Don't worry about it, they know better than you.
