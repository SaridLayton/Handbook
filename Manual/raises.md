# Raises

> We do not give "cost of living" increases, and we do not give raises.

The key confusion here is "**inflationary raise**" vs. "**right-sizing due to  actually learning a great deal and now doing a whole different job**". These are very different ideas.

### Right-Sizing

At least once a year, each Pod Leader will look into the balance of industry standard value for your role and ensure we are paying you commensurate with industry standard salaries, ideally, through third-party analysis (currently, PayScale). Ideally, the Pod then right-sizes you to this level. However, the possiblity exists that your Pod is not actually generating a level of revenue that can support your industry standard comparitive value.

1. There needs to be a plan to improve the revenue of the Pod so that it can afford you at a right-sized rate. You should be personally responsible for helping revenue get there.
2. You should quit, or request a Full-Review.

At any reasonable point, you should be able to make a reaonsable claim that you are not being paid commensurate with the job you are actually doing. If you do this more than every few quarters, you are probably just complaining.

### "Raises"

The working world has been indoctrinated with the idea that "raises should always happen", and a steady increase of wage is a natural and organic entitlement of an "employee". Traditionally, if an employee does exactly the same job for many years, a steady raise should always happen. If said employee is doing a good job year after year, they should always get a raise to compensate for "inflation" - 3-5%.

However, by this logic, a production person who works for a company for 50 years will eventually be paid 250% of what he or she was originally hired for even if he or she does not do anything differently than the day he or she started. Suddenly you are working for General Motors getting paid $48 an hour to screw in the same bolt all day. This renders the company toothless and incapable of being competitive or innovative due to a false bubble of entitlements. GM is not designed to last 1000 years - it can only abuse you and then fire you if it wants to survive. This hampers the success of future generations.

The impact of this trend is excacerbated at Treefrog when we are not equally compensating by raising prices of products by 3% every year. All inflationary raises do is cut into Treefrog's capacity for survival without adding value to the organization as opposed to Treefrog's belief that "All Frogs can Grow". Therefore, the traditional broken solution is to:

1. Fire people regularly to keep costs down. This is counterintuitive to Treefrog's core.
2. End up with a slew of over-paid employees possibly through unionization.
3. Not give raises and make people think they are doing something wrong because they expect to get a raise for just performing the same job.

Raises should not be tied to performance or tenure. Raises should be tied exclusively to contribution or output (which should increase due to performance and/or tenure). In other words, "Treefrog does not give out raises" - we just "right-size" people commensurate with the industry-standard pay of their role compared to their output. 

#### Requesting a "Full Review"

If you believe you are being radically underpaid commensurate with your role (>5-10%), at any time, you can request a "full review" of your salary. The following mechanism then takes place:

1. We work together to define your role.
2. You will go actively looking for work elsewhere. Should you get a justifiably equal offer, we will match the offer.
3. BUT, we will also be actively looking for a replacement. Should we find a replacement at a lower cost with more experience, you agree to immediately resign your position without notice or any further entitlements on the day the replacement starts. Our commitment to "Frog loyalty" transfers to "Mutual Acceptance of an Alternate fit that allows you to move on".

This is not intended as a threat to the Frogs or as a mechanism to induce "Stockholm Syndrome" to force people to stay in an underpaid environment. That would be against our philosophy. However, if someone's miseducated entitlement has superseded his or her current capacity, it is inevitable that his or her discretionary effort will drop to nothing, and we mutually inherit mediocracy.

Mediocracy is the greatest evil.
