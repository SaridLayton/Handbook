# Raises

> You do not get a raise for doing your job. You get a salary.

The world seems to believe that "raises should always happen". That a steady increase of wage is a natural and organic thing. That if you do exactly the same job for many years, a steady raise should always happen. That if you are doing a good job, year after year, you should always get a raise to compensate for "inflation" - 3-5%.

However, by this logic, a production person who works for a company for 50 years will eventually be paid 250% of what they were originally hired for even if he or she do not do anything differently than the day they started. Suddenly you are GM, paying employees $48 an hour to screw in the same bolt all day.

I find this particularly irritating when we are not equally compensating by raising prices of products by 3% every year (maybe this is our problem). All inflationary raises do is cut into profit. Therefore, the solution is to:

a) fire people regularly, to keep your costs down 

b) end up with a slew of over-paid employees 

c) not give raises and make people think they are doing something wrong because they expect to get a raise just for showing up.

My theory is that raises should not be tied to performance or tenure at all. Raises should be tied exclusively to contribution.

The key confusion here is "inflationary raise" vs. "right-sizing due to do actually learning a great deal and now doing a whole different job".

#### Right-Sizing

At any point, you can lay the claim that you are not being paid commensurate with the job you are actually doing.
