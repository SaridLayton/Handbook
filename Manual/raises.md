# Raises

> We don't give "cost of living" increases, and we don't give raises.

<i>The working world has been indoctrinated with the idea that "raises should always happen", that a steady increase of wage is a natural and organic entitlement of an "employee". Traditionally, if an employee does exactly the same job for many years, a steady raise should always happen, and that if said employee is doing a good job, year after year, they should always get a raise to compensate for "inflation" - 3-5%.</i>

However, by this logic, a production person who works for a company for 50 years will eventually be paid 250% of what they were originally hired for even if he or she do not do anything differently than the day they started. Suddenly you are working for General Motors, getting paid $48 an hour to screw in the same bolt all day - and rendering the company toothless and incapable of being competitive or innovative due to a false bubble of entitlements. GM isn't designed to last 1000 years - it can only abuse you and then fire you if it wants to survive - which hampers the success of future generations.

The impact of this trend is excacerbated at Treefrog when we are not equally compensating by raising prices of products by 3% every year. All inflationary raises do is cut into our capacity for survival without adding value to the organization (as opposed to our belief that "All Frogs can Grow"). Therefore, the traditional broken solution is to:

1. Fire people regularly, to keep costs down (counterintuitive to Treefrog's core).
2. End up with a slew of over-paid employees - possibly through unionization.
3. Not give raises and make people think they are doing something wrong because they expect to get a raise just for showing up.

Raises should not be tied to performance or tenure. Raises should be tied exclusively to contribution or output. In other words, "Treefrog doesn't give our raises" - we just "right-size" people commensurate with the industry-standard pay of their role compared to their output. 

The key confusion here is "inflationary raise" vs. "right-sizing due to do actually learning a great deal and now doing a whole different job".

#### Right-Sizing

At least oce a year, each Pod Leader will look into the balance of industry standard value for your role and ensure we are paying you commensurate with industry standard salaries. Ideally, the Pod then right-sizes you to this level. However, the possiblity exists that your Pod isn't actually generating a level of revenue that can support your industry standard comparitive value.

1. There needs to be a plan to improve the revenue of the Pod so it can afford you at a right-sized rate. You should be personally repsonsible for helping it get there.
2. You should quit, or call a Full-Review.

At any reasonable point, you should be able to make a reaonsable claim that you are not being paid commensurate with the job you are actually doing.

#### Calling in a "Full Review"

If you believe you are being radically underpaid commensurate with your role (>5-10%), at any time you can request a "full review" of your salary. The following mechanism then kicks in;

1. We work together to define your role.
2. You go actively look for work elsewhere. Should you get a justifiably equal offer, we match the offer.
3. BUT, we also actively look for a replacement for you. Should we find a replacement for you at a lower cost with more experience, you agree to immediately resign your position to the new person without notice or any further entitlements (or upon the day they start). Our commitment to "Frog loyalty" transfers to "Mutual Acceptance of Alternate fit that allows you to move on".

This is not intended as a threat to the Frogs, or a mechanism to induce "Stockholm Syndrome" to force people to stay in an underpaid environment (this is against our philosophy). However, if someone's miseducated entitlement has superseded their (current) capacity, it is inevitable that their discretionary effort will drop to nothing and we mutually inherit mediocracy.

Mediocracy is the greatest evil.
