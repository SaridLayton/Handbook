# Bereavement, Pregnancy and Other Leaves of Absences

### Bereavement Leave TEST

In the event of a death of an immediate family member, Frogs are entitled to a bereavement leave with the CEOâ€™s approval. Frogs who wish to take a bereavement leave shall provide notice to their pod leader as soon as practicable after learning of a death that qualifies for this type of leave.    All full-time Frogs with one (1) or more years of continuous service will be granted up to three (3) days of bereavement leave with pay.   

Immediate family includes:

* A spouse
* A parent, step-parent, foster parent, child, step-child, foster child, grandparent, step-grandparent, grandchild or step-grandchild of the employee or the employee's spouse
* The spouse of the employee's child
* A brother or sister of the employee
* A relative of the employee who is dependent on the employee for care or assistance
 
Additional paid or unpaid bereavement leave may be granted at the discretion of the CEO. These requests should be discussed in person with the CEO and followed by a written submission.

### Pet Emergencies

> We love dogs and cats, too. But the math of business can't afford to cover their death.

Treefrog recognizes and appreciates that pets are sources of great happiness and stress relief. However, unlike family members, pets tend to have shorter life spans and are a life choice. You pick your pet; you do not pick your family. The burden of this life choice falls to you, not to the Frogs. Any work time lost due to pet-related emergencies must be managed through as a vacation day or be made up through additional worked hours.

### Family Medical Leave

> If someone in your immediate family is seriously ill, you should look after them.

Family medical leave is a job protected leave under the ESA that applies to all frogs regardless of how long they have worked here.  It can be taken to provide care and support to certain family members for whom a qualified health practitioner has issued a certificate stating that this family member has a serious illness with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks. Family medical leave is **unpaid, job-protected leave** of up to 8 weeks in a 26 week period. The 8 weeks do not have to be taken consecutively but must be taken in at least one week blocks of time. The Frog is responsible to inform the CEO that he or she is requesting a family medical leave of absence in advance of the commencement of the leave or as soon as possible. The Frog is responsible for providing proof from a qualified health practitioner, and upon receiving this, Treefrog will issue a record of employment that can be taken to the employment insurance office to determine if the Frog is eligible for compassionate care benefits.

This is a default concept, but we want to be considerate of one another. So sit down with your pod leader or the CEO and come to an intelligent resolution around how you can best work together.

### Pregnancy Leave

> Take some time to enjoy your new baby.

Pregancy is another job protected leave under the ESA.  A Frog is entitled to 17 weeks of unpaid pregancy leave if the Frog has been employed by Treefrog for at least 13 weeks preceding the expected date of delivery. Any Frog entitled to the leave must give notice in writing to the CEO at least 2 weeks prior to the date the leave is to begin, but the more notice the better.

We are cognizant that pregnancy and child-bearing is a beautiful, natural, and important process, and we want to work together with you to ensure the child is cared for appropriately. Different newborns and different parents have different needs. Let us work through this together.

> The kid makes the rules, not you. Keep us in the loop!

Also note that we are aware that, under most circumstances, the complexities of child birth and return-to-work dynamics are often filled with twists and turns - and the more Treefrog knows about your twists and turns, the more we can be adquately prepared for your return. Stay in touch!

### Parental Leave

Parental leave is another job protected leave under the ESA.  A Frog who is a parent and has been employed for at least 13 weeks is entitled to 35 weeks of unpaid parental leave following the birth of the child or 37 weeks for non-birth parents. A Frog who is entitled to parental leave must provide notice in writing at least two weeks before the leave is scheduled to commence. If he or she does not state when the leave will end, it will be assumed that he or she wishes to take the maximum leave.

### Parental Leave Options

Special projects may be able to be arranged for Frogs who are interested in working from home while caring for his or her new baby. This is highly contingent on your role, skills, and the work available at Treefrog.

### Other Leaves of Absences

All Frogs are also entitled to additional job-protected leaves of absences under the ESA.  These include:  Family Caregiver Leave, Critically-Ill Child Care Leave, and Crime-related Death and Disappearance Leave.  Please speak to Human Resources for more information.

### Court or Jury Duty

Treefrog will excuse Frogs from work for court or jury duty. Any Frog called by a court or subpoenaed to attend as a witness, will be given the time off work to meet this obligation. Upon selection for such duty, the Frog must notify the CEO immediately. If attendance at the court is not required on any given day, or if the Frog is dismissed from the court before the end of the work day, the Frog is expected to report to work and carry out his or her office responsibilties for the remainder of that day.
