# Performance

> 

Treefrog Inc. is committed to providing clear performance expectations and work standards for all Frogs in all jobs with the objective of maximizing performance, efficiency, and quality. Treefrog believes that performance appraisals are critical to enhancing performance and job satisfaction. The appraisal process is intended to be a two way dialogue similar to the “state of the union” open table discussions. Any new job tasks or duties to be assigned will be discussed and agreed upon with a time frame established. Performance review discussion will take place annually.

### Performance Improvement

The performance improvement process is to ensure the optimization of productivity and quality is not intended as punishment. Treefrog hires carefully and invests heavily in Frog growth and development. We believe in working with Frogs to solve problems through the use of the performance improvement process rather than finding a replacement for the position. We believe in giving Frog’s fair warning with the performance problem and the consequence for continuing the poor performance. Throughout the performance improvement process, the performance problem will be thoroughly and promptly investigated and documented to ensure rules are enforced equally for all Frogs.
