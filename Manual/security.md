# Security

Like any business, Treefrog wants to protect its employees and its financial interests. During regular office hours, the doors, both front and back, should be open for staff, clients, and couriers. These doors may be open before and/or after regular hours providing there are employees in the office to monitor the traffic. he last person to leave at the end of the night is responsible for arming the building with the security code as well as locking all doors and windows. The last person leaving every night is to ensure all doors and windows are locked and the security system is armed. Failure to do so introduces high risk to Treefrogâ€™s assets and confidentiality, and, as such, is subject to disciplinary action or termination. Security system code is confidential and should not be given out to anyone under any circumstances. Sharing the security system code outside of Treefrog may result in disciplinary action or termination.

For customer service and security reasons, the office policy requires two people present in the office at all times during the core business hours of 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. There must be one person from the design team and one person for the technical team. Please ensure you schedule your meals and breaks accordingly.

### Working Alone

In the event that you are working alone, you must ensure you have communicated and received prior approval from the CEO or the Controller. If it is after regular business hours, you must have the doors locked and send a message to the Controller or CEO prior to leaving at the end of the night.

Under no circumstances are you to have a client meeting alone in the office after hours. If a client meeting is required after hours, it must be scheduled in a public setting.

It is not acceptable to bring friends or other personal guests into the office location off hours. This is a breach of company privacy and would require approval from the CEO.
