# Pay

> Payment of Frogs shouldn't get in the way of life or productivity.

<i> We intentionally do things which require more administration and hassle at Treefrog to make it easier on Frogs and their familes.</i>

### Pay Schedule: Weekly

Treefrog pays salaried employees on a weekly basis on the week subsequent to the week worked. Payment is by Direct Deposit on Friday. In order to best benefit Frogs, we endeavour to pay earlier than this to minimize banking turnaround limitations.

Despite the difficulties this presents to cash flow and banking costs associated, it has been our experience that this greatly helps Frogs (especially at the beginning of their careers) to live without "bumps".

#### By Cheque

If by chance you cannot recieve pay by Direct Deposit, you may be paid by cheque. Cheques are distributed on Fridays.  It is the employee’s responsibility to collect his or her cheque on the allocated day of distribution.  In the event of a statutory holiday falling on the normal cheque distribution day, cheques will be distributed on the day prior to the statutory holiday.

### Employment Status

Full time is defined as working a regular 40 hour work week or more. Part time is 24 hours or less per week. Temporary Frogs are employed to fill a temporary vacancy or carry out a specific function for a period of time.

### Payment

Payment is by Direct Deposit weekly on Fridays. It is the Frogs responsibility to collect his or her cheque from the controller on the allocated day of distribution. In the event of a statutory holiday falling on the normal cheque distribution day, cheques will be distributed the day prior to the holiday.
