# Conflicts of Interest

Conflicts of interest arise when a Frog becomes involved in any business or other activity that may conflict with the best interests of Treefrog or in any way, interfere with the Frog’s ability to completely carry out his or her responsibilities.

Our policy is to conduct business ethically and to avoid conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts. All Frogs have an equal duty to avoid conflicts of interest. You must fully disclose and refrain from engaging in any activities that create a conflict of interest between your personal interests and the interests of the company. You are expected to report conflicts of interest to the CEO immediately upon discovery or suspicion of a conflict.

Conflicts include, but are not limited to, the following situations:

- Ownership by you or a family member of a substantial financial interest in any outside concern that does business with, or is a competitor to, Treefrog (except where such interest consists of an insubstantial percentage of a publicly-owned corporation)
- Rendering services to any outside concern, including your own or that of a family member, that does business with or is a competitor of Treefrog
- Having other employment or another job that may be performed in off-hours (also known as “moonlighting”) regardless of whether the second employer is a competitor of Treefrog without prior approval
- Acceptance by you or a family member of gifts (of more than token value), loans, (other than from established financial institutions), excessive entertainment, or other substantial favours from any outside concern that does business with, or is seeking to do business with, or is a competitor of Treefrog
- Making false or artificial entry or failing to make an entry where required in the books or records of the company for any reason including the establishment or maintenance of any fund, bank account, or other asset of the company that is undisclosed, unrecorded, or inaccurately described in the books and records of the company and the making or receipt of any payment, the purpose of which is not accurately described in the company’s books and records
- Making any payment by or on behalf of the company to any official Frog or agent of any government other than as required by law
- Making any payment by or on behalf of the company to any political party, political organization, or candidate for political office, except as permitted by law and approved by the CEO
- Making any payment to any party for the purpose of obtaining unlawful or unethical preferential treatment for the company or a client of the company
- Transaction of personal business with third persons in such a manner or under such circumstances that may cause the third persons to believe they are dealing with the company rather than you individually; for example, transacting personal business on stationery with the company’s letterhead
- Competition, directly or indirectly, in the purchase or sale of property or property rights or interests
