> Travel at reasonable rates, only when necessary.

All travel requires CEO approval before any bookings are made.

Travelers must accept the lowest airfare and hotel rates. (Within reason, use your common sense and don't stay in a dangerous part of town or incur high Taxi costs to save on hotel rates).
