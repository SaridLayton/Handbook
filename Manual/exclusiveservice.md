# Exclusivity

> You only have ONE job.

Exclusive Service, also know as “Moonlighting”, refers to doing work, paid or not paid, for a client or for yourself, "after hours". As Treefrog is a service business with flexible hours, offering multiple products and services, we represent dozens of skills and disciplines. This is a fairly complex issue with many variables. It would be a bureaucratic nightmare to police or describe all of the specifics of this policy so we make it simple - don't do it.

Bottom line, if you are a salaried employee, we pay for your exclusive service at Treefrog, meaning you cannort work elsewhere.

### Types of Moonlighting

If you are doing work after hours that is unrelated to your work at Treefrog, then you are moonlighting. **Some of these are in conflict of interest with Treefrog and some are not.** This work can fall into a few different areas:

1. **Second Completely Different Job** - You are doing work completely unrelated to Treefrog. (I.e. being a waitress, or an actor).
2. **Hobby Work** - You have a regular "hobby" on the side that generates regular revenue (i.e. selling soap, or selling tupperware). If you don't get paid for it, it's a "hobby", not "hobby work", and thus not relevant.
3. **For a Good Cause** - You are doing work that Treefrog would usually do, but you have rationalized doing it for a “family member”, or a “not for profit”, or because “the client couldn’t afford Treefrog’s pricing”, or you feel obligated to do it for the individual because of your relationship with them. You could be doing it for free, or for pay, or for free for someone else who is getting paid like a family member.
4. **Competitive Conflict of Interest** - You are doing work for someone whose work "could have been done by Treefrog" for pay.
5. **Direct Conflict of Interest** - You are doing work for one of our clients on the side.
6. **Community Support** - You are working for a not for profit on the side to help the community to do work that does not create a conflict of interest with Treefrog’s products or services (i.e. handing out hotdogs).
7. **Religious Activity Work** - Not relevant.

Note that our contracts are very clear on the matter - you have agreed to “exclusive service” with Treefrog and that any work you do on the side is grounds to lose your job without warning. We are not an hourly-pay company. We pay you a salary for your time and energy, with lots of bells and whistles, and the expectation is that all of your energy belongs to Treefog.

Please note that we have made offers to potential superstar employees who would not sign this agreement in the past, and not hired them. This is core to the spirit of Treefrog employment. Treefrog has your back, and you have Treefrog’s back - Frog for Life.

### The Rationale

At the root of our policy, our intent is not to be draconian, and make your life miserable or prevent you from being successful. There are some simple issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Total Net Energy** - If you are working at another organization or have another job after hours or on weekends, you are not re-charging effectively in your time off. This will lead you to having less energy, be more difficult and grumpy with other Frogs, and lose variables and information relevant to your salaried role when the other job creates stress and exhaustion. You are less valuable to Treefrog, and we should not have to pay your full salaried price for a fraction of your energy and ongoing reduced mental capacity. You are undermining your future here and compromising other team members' ability to do things effectively.
2. **Competing for Time** - Our philosophy enables you to take time off during Treefrog hours to make your life less stressful. If you have another job, it is Treefrog and your peers that suffers when you need to use Treefrog's time to buy groceries or get sick from exhaustion regardless if it directly related to the other position or not. At the core of our magnificent flexibility is the assumption that we aren't flexing around another company's work schedule, but around your "life", where "life" allows an individual to recharge, do new, exciting and interesting activities to stretch you as an individual, and having fun.
3. **You are Treefrog’s Competitor** - If you are doing work that Treefrog would do, irrelevant of trappings of price, etc., you are a competitor. This is, under Canadian Law, akin to theft.
4. **You are Leveraging Treefrog’s Investments for your Own Selfish Gain** - Let’s hope you aren’t using Treefrog’s assets for your own purposes like software, a computer, or a document Treefrog has paid to put together. Doing these things would be blatantly illegal. However, the education, knowledge, processes, etc. that you have developed at Treefrog belongs to us as a team. Using them externally undermines Treefrog's value in the marketplace. Why would anyone pay for a logo if you can lean on a designer to get one for free?
5. **You are Damaging the Marketplace** - You wonder why people don’t want to pay $150/hour for your work, and want a raise, yet you are creating a competitive environment where people believe they should be able to get these services less expensively.
6. **You are Creating Competitors for OUR Clients** - So you build a website that has nothing to do with our clients and suddenly, we get a client in the same space. Treefrog now has to either fire you or the client has the right to sue Treefrog. Or your side-client ends up competing with Treefrog and is obvlivious to the conflict.
7. **It Usually Goes Sideways** - We have created a very complex mechanism to bill, protect, clarify, and deliver our products and services. When you do work on your own, you could get sued, have to stay up ridiculously late, have to take time off, have to cancel your plans, have to have multiple accounts, etc. Your projects can and will go sideways adding stress and complexity reducing your value to Treefrog and your team.
8. **You Have Created a Potential Legal Issue** - You represent Treefrog, even when not at work. If you are working off-hours, the client with whom you have agreed to do the work for could lay claim that your equipment/knowledge/whatever was connected to Treefrog and Treefrog has now been dragged into your fight without proper protections for which we pay so dearly.
9. **You Lessen Your Passion** - If you make a thousand widgets during the day and love doing it and then go home and make widgets on the side for fun or for profit, eventually, your passion for making widgets will burn out. You may think it will not but your brain needs balance to be fully self-actualized. You need a break from work.
10. **You are Setting a Cultural Precedent** - Sure, doing that one thing isn’t a big deal. Suddenly, someone is a full-time nurse on the side, taking days off to get shifts, and thinks it is OK cause “Treefrog has flexible hours". Gimme a break.

It is pretty much impossible to work a second job and not compromise your work at Treefrog. Ultimately, you working on the side affects us all negatively. You are making a decision that affects Treefrog and your team members drastically.

### Why Would Anyone Engage in Conflict of Interest Work?

**You are Broke and Need More Money** - If this is the case and you are working your full expectation of work hours, Treefrog would be happy to engage you in a side contract to do something else. A “ninja project” as it were. Although this is pushing the boundaries of the ESA, Employment Standard Act, I would rather you got exhausted adding value to Treefrog, even if it outside your current skill set, rather than trigger all of the points above. Imagine getting paid to improve LEAP, or paint some walls? Imagine improving your own day-job life with your night-time life? Alternatively, you have the wrong career-choice VS lifestyle mix. Let's talk about it.

**You Want to Help a Not-For-Profit** - Great, Treefrog would love to participate too as ist is part of our bottom line as a company. Bring your project forward and let's consider doing the project together where the whole team has your back.

**You are Getting Peer Pressured from Family, Church or Friends** - Often we get attacked to do something on the side because "our mom can't afford it". After reading all of the points above, if you still believe you must do work for said individual and can't use the excuse "but I could get fired over it", then it must be really, really important to you. Let's talk about it.

**Your Mom Has a Web Company** - Your Mom just started a web company, and you think you should help her as it keeps money in the family. I'm pretty sure every court in the world would arrive at the same conclusion - you should go work for her full time.

**You are Bored** - Your Champion can cure your boredom pretty quickly. Please go see them immediately.

**Self-Improvement** - OK, this is a good rationale. You want to learn to do something and are willing to work on the side to improve your skills  in order to improve your value to Treefrog. Please note, if this is your 5th Wordpress site that you are getting paid to do, I don't think you have much to stand on. However, I agree, there's no reason to not get paid to do something ONCE. Disclose it. Let's talk about the effect on the team as a whole.

### The Bottom Line

The key question that puts your work in critical danger is, "Are you in direct conflict with Treefrog and with your work?" The Acid Test to determining whether you are in direct conflict with the work you are performing is easy. Ask yourself the question, "Would Treefrog sell this irrelevant of the trappings of price, quality, goals, etc.?" If you are confused or if it is a grey area, you need to ask a senior individual at Treefrog if it crosses the line or not.

**Second Completely Different Job Conflicts** - If you are working a second job, “Energy Draining Work”, you are less valuable to Treefrog for what we are paying you for. You need to disclose this fact and it needs to be considered the next time you are eligible for a raise, re-thinking your role, etc. We reserve the right to not pay you the percentage of time under 40 hours a week that you have not worked and re-set your salary at this lower level moving forward if you wish to keep your job. We also reserve the right to give you more free time to pursue this work. All of it in fact.

**Hobby Work Conflicts** - If you have a hobby on the side that leads to revenue, you need to disclose it to Treefrog and explain how it will not affect your current job. You cannot claim Conflict of Interest work as a hobby, that’s just regular work. **(See Damaging the Marketplace**)

**Community Support Work (Conflict of Interest)** - Simply put, one of the bottom lines of Treefrog’s existence is helping the community. If your church needs a website and wants you to do it for them, approach Treefrog about it. Perhaps we can do it inexpensively, or you could do it on the side for pay with limited team support, and Treefrog can broadcast our involvement, thus, bringing the additional value to Treefrog. There is always a way.

**Community Support Work (Not Conflict of Interest)** - Treefrog believes that wanting to volunteer at a local theatre or local Soup Kitchen is fantastic! Although the volunteering will affect Treefrog through your lowered net energy, it will also help balance your brain, bringing you satisfaction as an individual because helping the world makes our lives meaningful. If the possibility exists that it might affect your work, say through a day off or reduced energy, disclose it and allow Treefrog to own it with you. In other words, we’ll support you in your volunteerism and broadcast your involvemen, thus, bringing additional value to Treefrog in return.

**Direct Conflict of Interest Work** - This will result in the end of your engagement with Treefrog. We are obligated to take legal action against you to prevent liability for ourselves in the future.

**Marginal Conflict of Interest Work** - You believe that your potential client, or client, “can’t afford Treefrog’s pricing”. This could be because they are just getting started or any of the reasons listed above. You are obligated to disclose and discuss these reasons with your Pod Leader or the CEO. We will look at the points above and discuss a go-forward plan.

**Your Own Project on the Side** - This needs to be covered under a different discussion, namely, Intellectual Property. Bottom line, disclose, disclose, disclose. This will allow you to determine and have a better understanding if it is an appropriate project to work on or not.

You are required to disclose to Treefrog what work you are doing.

#### How To Handle Getting Asked for Direct Competitive Work

Many people at Treefrog have been asked by clients to do work under the table for them. A few past Frogs have tried and are no longer with us. If a client asks you to do this, immediately disclose this to the CEO and refuse the work. Should you take the work, you are relinquishing your right to employment with Treefrog.

#### How to Handle Work That Treefrog Would DO

Approach the CEO and disclose all of the facets of the potential work. Consider if this helps your career or if it limits your career. Consider if it helps your team or compromises your team.

Make sure there is a paper trail.

#### How to Handle it if you are Working Now, Cause You Forgot This Section Of Our Employee Manual

Disclose it immediately. Let’s discuss it.

If you disclose it immediately, we can discuss options for moving forward. If you don’t disclose it, each and every time, it is grounds for termination.
