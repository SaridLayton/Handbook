# Emergencies

> If your family member dies, you should take a break and mourn.

Treefrog is aware that things happen and time off is sometimes needed. Therefore, it is Treefrog’s policy to provide up to three (3) days paid leave to a Frog for emergency leave due to: death, illness, injury, medical emergency, or urgent matter relating to the following family members:

1. A spouse*
2. A parent, step-parent, foster parent, child, step-child, foster child, grandparent, step-grandparent, grandchild or step-grandchild of the employee or the employee's spouse
3. The spouse of an employee's child
4. A brother or sister of the employee
5. A relative of the employee who is dependent on the employee for care or assistance
6. Any person who lives with the employee as a member of the family


*Note: “spouse” includes both married and common-law couples of the same sex or the opposite sex.

Under special circumstances, bereavement leave may be granted upon the passing of a significant person in the individual’s life who is not an immediate family member. Bereavement leave under these circumstances must be applied for in advance and approved by the individual’s manager. This does not usually apply to third-party relationships such as the passing away of a friend's friend.

You cannot carry over unused emergency leave days.

Special considerations may be made for individuals whose family members are not locate and/or need to travel overseas.

### Pet Emergencies

Treefrog recognizes and appreciates that pets are sources of great happiness and stress relief. However, unlike family members, pets tend to have shorter life spans and are a life choice. You pick your pet, you don't pick your family. The burden of this life choice falls to you, not to the Frogs. Any work time lost due to pet-related emergencies must be managed through as holiday or be made up through additional worked hours.

### Family Medical Leave

Family medical leave may be taken to provide care and support to certain family members for whom a qualified health practitioner has issues a certificate stating that this family member has a serious illness with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks. Family medical leave is unpaid, job protected leave of up to 8 weeks in a 26 week period. The 8 weeks do not have to be taken consecutively but must be taken in at least one week blocks of time. The Frog is responsible to inform the CEO that he or she is requesting a family medical leave of absence in advance of the commencement of the leave or as soon as possible. The Frog is responsible to provide proof from a qualified health practitioner and upon receiving this, Treefrog will issue a record of employment that can be taken to the employment insurance office to determine if the Frog is eligible for compassionate care benefits.

This is a default concept, but we want to be considerate of one another. So sit down with your Champion or the CEO and come to an intelligent resolution around how you can best work together.
### Pregnancy Leave

Treefrog provides pregnancy leaves of absence without pay to all eligible Frogs according to the guidelines set out in Ontario’s Employment Standards Act. A Frog is entitled to 17 weeks of unpaid leave of absence for pregnancy if the Frog has been employed by Treefrog for at least 13 weeks preceding the expected date of delivery. A Frog entitled to the leave must give notice in writing to the CEO at least 2 weeks prior to the date the leave is to begin, but the more notice the better.

We are cognizant that pregnancy and child-bearing is a beautiful, natural, and important process, and we want to work together with you to ensure the child is cared for appropriately. Different newborns and different parents have different needs. Let's work through this together.
### Parental Leave

Treefrog Inc. offers new parents the right to parental leave according to the requirements of the Ontario Employment Standards Act. A Frog who is a parent and has been employed for at least 13 weeks is entitled to 35 weeks of unpaid parental leave following the birth of the child or 37 weeks for non-birth parents. A Frog who is entitled to parental leave must provide notice in writing at least two weeks before the leave is scheduled to commence. If he or she does not state when the leave will end, it will be assumed that he or she wishes to take the maximum leave.

##### Parental Leave Options

Special projects may be able to be arranged for Frog’s who are interested in working from home while caring for their new baby. This is highly contingent on your role, skills, and contingent upon the work available at Treefrog.

### Court of Jury Duty

Treefrog will excuse Frogs from work for court or jury duty. Any Frog called by a court or subpoenaed to attend as a witness, will be given the time off work to meet this obligation. Upon selection for such duty, the Frog must notify the CEO immediately. If attendance at the court is not required on any given day, or if the Frog is dismissed from the court before the end of the work day, the Frog is expected to report to work and carryout his or her office responsibilties for the remainder of that day. s
