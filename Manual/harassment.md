# Harassment

> Do not be a jerk.

We expect our employees to treat each other with fairness and respect. Harassment on the basis of race, religion, gender, age, handicap, or national origin will not be tolerated.

Harassment includes any conduct that interferes with a personâ€™s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

An employee who believes that he or she has been subject to any type of harassment should immediately contact his or her [Pod-Champion](manual/pod-champion.md) **and** the CEO directly.

#### Sexual Harassment

It is against the policies of the company for any employee to sexually harass another employee by:

- making sexual advances, requesting sexual favours, or making other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature
- making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions that would affect the employee
- creating a hostile or offensive work environment by such conduct
- sending, receiving, viewing, or printing of unacceptable or harassing emails, web sites, or other electronic media.

An employee who feels he or she has suffered from sexual harassment should report such incidents to his or her supervisor or senior management without fear of reprisal.

In determining whether an alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the totality of the circumstances, the nature of the harassment, and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred will be investigated.

Treefrog considers sexual harassment to be a major offence that can result in the discharge of the offender.
