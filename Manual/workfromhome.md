# Work From Home

> You are not as valuable to Treefrog when you work from home. So don't.

Every once and a while, working from home can be a nice change. The effect of that nice change is, you have the perception that you are super-productive, despite the cost of others being less productive. However, once it becomes a habit, your productiveness and value to the team overall greatly decreases exponentially.

Working from home causes the following negative issues;

1. **Communication** - Communication with your team members is radically reduced. Although some communication can happen through technology - person to person contact is still the most effective mechanism for understanding. We have proven this time and time again.
2. **Rapport** - Your overall relationship with members of the team - which helps make you and communication with you more efficient - is reduced. We hire people we like being around. We don't want you staying at home. We want you here, so we can enjoy life together.
3. **Efficiency** - You just don't have universal access to things (like the file server) when you are at home. You get more done, and are thus more valuable, when you have access to the team and to our trappings. There is a tangible proximity effect.
4. **Accessibility** - You may have something we need - a piece of information or a password. We may have something you need. Your body is the company's interface to your head - which is what we are paying for.
5. **Agility** - Things are constantly changing around here. If you aren't here, you can't help the team be agile when clients change their minds, processes change, or project timelines change.
6. **Trust** - Everybody does a little laundry when they are "working from home". Then suddenly, a quick break to watch some TV in the background (See: [Distractions](manual/Distractions)), a quick dog walk and then maybe a little snooze. But then I am so much more perky and functional! Horseshit. You are fooling yourself. It's a slippery slope that the best of us have slid down.
7. **Effect on Others** - Sure, you don't get bugged when you work from home. That's because, other people are being bugged in your place. And now, it has a multiplyer effect, because not only do they not have the information you have, but their own work is compromised. You are making other people less productive.

We are much more efficient if we are all working together in real life. We have spent a lot of money and time and effort trying to make a space where we can all be effective. Let's not waste it.

### Emergency Work From Home

If you have a critical reason to stay home to work (you need to look after a litter of new-born ferrets whose mother died in a freak house-cleaning incident, or your gas pipes burst and you need to stay home to let the fire department stand around and smoke), you have a few options, involving *not working*;

1. If you have holiday time, you can take a day off as holiday.
2. If you don't have holiday time, you can request special permission to not get paid that day *This cannot happen regularly, due to [the-cost-of-people](manual/the-cost-of-people.md).
3. You can make the work up in the evening or on weekends.
4. You can make very specific arrangements with your Champion to work from home this once.*

*There needs to be a genuine emergency for this to happen. Looking after your dog is not an emergency. It's a life choice. If you failed to make good decisions which would allow you to come into work every day, you need to make different life decisions, or set your life up so that you can still be a remarkable Frog.

### Bummed Out

Every once in a while we feel like staying home because we are bummed out or because we had a disagreement with a fellow Frog or client and don't feel like dealing with it. Things get complex when so many people work together, and this can make it difficult to be effective.

If you believe you are suffering from Depression, please seek medical help immediately. This plagues most of us (especially during the long winter months), and you may need couselling or medication to stay sane.

If you need a day off, and your pod can handle the work load in your absence, then take a [vacation](manual/vacation.md) day. Take a break. We all need them from time to time.

Otherwise, gut-up. This is not a daycare. This is a job, and you should be present for it. The definition of a professional is someone who does their best work on their worst day.
### Work From Home Because You'd Like To

Once in a while, if you'd like to work from home to accomplish a specific and meaningful and long-term task, you may work from home under the following conditions if your Champion believes that you can work from home this one time given your work load;

1. Consider the implications to your team and projects
2. Ask permission to do so
3. Do not do it on Mondays or Fridays (it smells like cheating)
4. Do not do it two consecutive days in a row
5. Stay in communication at all times with your Champion*

*If at some point you turn off your phone or communication line with your Champion, you are not working.

Please be cognizant that working from home can easily persuade you from actually working - the pull of dishes, vacuuming, television, coffee, and more can be too much to bear. "All I need to do is a few more loads of laundry and then I can get back to work", I say to myself.
### Inclement Weather

In the event that weather conditions are severe and Frogs are unable to safely make it into the office, you may request to work from home. Frogs must notify the office prior to the beginning of their schedule and speak with their [pod-champion](manual/pod-champion.md). At this time an alternate schedule for the day can be agreed upon. If working from home Frogs are still required to complete a full day of work and log their time into the “Frog web” timesheet system. In the event that a regular working day is not completed, the non-working portion of the day will be considered vacation time and should be recorded to reflect this.

For those of you staying home - good call. Stay safe, there's too much paperwork if you die in a horrible snow-ball-related winter death. However, realize that Treefrog wants you to [live-close](manual/live-close.md) to home, so this isn't an issue.

Technically, Frogs should be able to survive the winter without problems. There are five known species of freeze-tolerant frogs in North America, including the well-studied wood frog, as well as Cope’s gray tree frog, the eastern gray tree frog, spring peepers and the western chorus frog. In the fall, these frogs bury themselves under the leaves on the forest floor — but not deeply enough to escape the icy fingers of Jack Frost.
